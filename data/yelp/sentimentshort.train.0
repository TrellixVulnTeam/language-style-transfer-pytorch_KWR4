i was sadly mistaken .
so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .
she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .
are you kidding me ?
i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
are you kidding me ?
i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
wake up or you are going to lose your business .
this place has none of them .
it is april and there are no grass tees yet .
there is no grass on the range .
bottom line , this place sucks .
someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
very disappointed in the customer service .
we will not be back .
the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
plus , _num_ of the new tires went flat within _num_ weeks .
terrible .
i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
so frustrated .
never going back .
they seem overpriced , too .
do n't waste your time .
not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
she was very uncomfortable .
at this point they were open and would be for another hour .
wait _num_ hrs .
she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .
absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !
this place went from great to horrible .
absolutely no problems .
noisy snow tires in the summer !
i told him they are too noisy .
very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .
i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .
i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .
sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
bread or not , it still was n't great .
it was a basic salad , no big deal .
i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .
just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .
but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .
if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
in a considerably nasty tone .
trash .
guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
nothing special .
it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .
it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .
ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .
the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
breakfast was pathetic .
i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
if i could give this place less than one star , i would .
apparently , we were out of luck .
it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
no more smoking allowed .
same lousy service .
i really really want this place to do better .
we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
it was gross .
the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .
no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .
i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .
what a mistake .
the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .
it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .
the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .
the corn lacked butter .
service was n't too bad - nice people .
unfortunately , there are only two reviews .
they did not acknowledge me .
the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .
does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
let alone one that the food is n't even that good .
also the inside is dirty as heck .
needless to say , we never returned .
otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
do n't take your cat here .
do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .
i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .
i did n't feel welcome here .
but it 's not well maintained .
terrible service .
but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .
there was no one filling up water .
my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .
so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
they did n't remake anything .
quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .
the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .
does that make you a little worried ?
ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .
consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .
it was so disgusting i could n't eat it .
ugh .
not a ton of flavor there either .
his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
and the chicken was very dry .
i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .
i wo n't go back .
the first time we were there almost _num_ hours .
ridiculous .
if it were up to me i would have never returned .
unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight .
my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .
bad food , slow service and rude managers .
papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .
obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
appalling !
my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .
and i hate wasting food !
do n't waste your time eating here .
there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .
well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
$ _num_ per salad ?
it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
$ _num_ / salad ?
our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .
we are not going back .
it rather looks like a deli counter .
a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
there was no salad or pasta side offered .
this alone i would have given _num_ stars .
annoying ?
confused ?
he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .
however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
why the hell was there a wait ?
the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
the food was not bad but it was not good .
the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .
no pasta was served with the chicken .
the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .
the total was $ _num_ and change .
my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
the waitress was extremely rude .
too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .
we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .
at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .
however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .
we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .
while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .
also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .
i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .
i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
i 'll probably never go back again .
worst service of all time .
place is a total joke .
the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .
okay , shame on us for not asking .
potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
never ever again will we return here .
not us .
just so rude .
the worst dental experience of my life .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .
save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .
no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .
the worst dental office i ever been .
you should avoid it at any time .
would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .
i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no sign of italian meat to be found .
no marinara sauce .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .
the cashier took my friends 's order , then promptly ignored me .
the manager was rude when giving me my order .
i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .
this mcdonald 's is so bad it 's amazing .
order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .
the soda machine was broken .
no sodas .
left with : big mac , medium fries , no coke .
there 's nothing to see here .
poor customer service .
worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked .
people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
soda is watered down and gross .
rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .
just skip this one and you will be better off .
seating inside is very limited .
i 'm not a huge fan of this location .
and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .
this has never happened before and it took me off guard .
the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .
i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !
finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .
this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .
the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
not at this location .
this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .
the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .
but the food came cold .
we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .
neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .
might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
def not worth the wait .
i really like the chili .
burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .
pretty hard to mess up a side salad .
as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .
store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
cheap and crap service .
unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
the service is awful .
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .
it was all i could taste .
tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .
i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .
this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
most of the time , they 're downright rude .
dirty and slow .
this location is terrible .
the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .
she then told me it only comes with cheese .
so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
the meat is badly burned and cold .
it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .
the service is the worst i 've ever seen .
i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .
i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .
take the extra _num_ minutes to drive to the south hills location .
food is cheap but portions are small .
also the restaurant is not really clean either .
this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
i really do n't know how this place stays open .
on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .
it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .
just bad service .
our waitress was very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
they completely ignored us so we got up and left .
one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention .
slow service .
food is very cheap though .
i would go here if the service was faster and better .
slow .
still no food .
we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .
i 've worked at steak n shake before .
it less than _num_ minutes to cook both the burgers and fries .
the manager here needs better training .
i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .
could n't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve .
waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .
terrible customer service .
five guy burgers much better .
this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .
the outside was filthy with trash all over .
the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .
the employees were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing .
i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .
disgusting .
i keep forgetting how not good this location is .
i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
actually there was nothing basement like about it .
what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
$ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?
in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
lame .
lame as heck .
the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
i would not recommend anybody go .
this place has gone significantly down hill .
however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
very slow and boring .
save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .
we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .
i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .
i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
what a shame !
so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .
clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .
the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .
if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
she sent it back .
no quick and easy app or beers on the house .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .
the first was flavorless and cold .
the second was passable , but nothing special .
and the last were absolutely awful .
i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
_num_ strikes .
i gave up and refused the offer for another .
i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich .
bar staff not so much this visit .
we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back .
neither of us were n't very happy about this .
menus for drinks and food have no prices .
$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
i could barely eat the salad .
perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .
i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .
the food was absolutely gross !
first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
gross !
mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .
the food is crap .
this time , it was ridiculous .
on top of that , the customer service sucked .
for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .
mediocre service .
cold food !
our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
bland food .
_num_ beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
here 's where it gets bad .
_num_ mins later we get our refills .
mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
i was frustrated .
finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .
yep , the food was cold .
the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .
waitress never apologized .
after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .
it was a saturday !
_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
all i have to say is get your crap together .
for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .
wo n't be back .
let me tell you about my bad experience first .
what the hell !
i was just really turned off from that experience .
lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
i will not be back again to eat .
the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .
the fish itself was bland .
i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
sometime you just get one that is n't .
this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
when our food came though , everything was below average .
did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .
needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .
it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .
i will never spend money here again !
awful awful .
took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
wrong !
first off , service was horrible .
it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .
my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .
was so salty and just not good .
for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .
you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !
everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
so we again go off in search of someone to help .
it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .
and not well maintained or managed at all .
over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .
grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .
mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .
huge fail for this type of venue .
service is n't too bad , but could be better .
i also thing d & b is n't the cleanest place either .
the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion .
does n't seem like they keep up with it .
to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
this was n't the cleanest place .
dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .
also they are n't following corporate policy .
very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
the food here is awful .
i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
everyone else at the table hated their food .
all i have to say is no thanks .
i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
worst service i 've ever had !
we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .
no apologies nothing .
while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .
they did n't even get their drinks .
i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
the food was bad .
the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .
the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .
if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .
awful place with rude people .
this place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years .
we will not be going back !
if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else .
even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .
we will still go here just not try to eat .
i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .
which i was , and i was not allowed in .
avoid eating or drinking anything here .
the service was terrible .
especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .
nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .
highly recommend that no one ever goes here .
our service was awful as well .
i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
but that 's not the worst .
despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
just come and play the games , but skip the food .
i wish there were no kids .
she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .
how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .
if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .
_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .
nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
staff is rude .
waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .
i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .
the food was n't very good at all .
i 've never sent back food , ever , but this was ridiculous .
the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
the frosty is never frosty always runny .
`` nah '' it was _num_ .
guess not .
cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
if there was a way to give no stars i would .
horrible service .
so we called back and asked for our money back .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .
- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
- none of the food was super awesome .
nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .
- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .
head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
the low point lately has been the food .
unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .
