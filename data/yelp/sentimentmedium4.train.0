i was sadly mistaken .
so on to the hoagies , the italian is general run of the mill .
minimal meat and a ton of shredded lettuce .
nothing really special & not worthy of the $ _num_ price tag .
second , the steak hoagie , it is atrocious .
i had to pay $ _num_ to add cheese to the hoagie .
she told me there was a charge for the dressing on the side .
are you kidding me ?
i was not going to pay for the dressing on the side .
i ordered it without lettuce , tomato , onions , or dressing .
are you kidding me ?
i paid $ _num_ to add sauted mushrooms , onions , and cheese .
in this case , never .
( the hoagie bun was better than average . )
wake up or you are going to lose your business .
this place has none of them .
it is april and there are no grass tees yet .
there is no grass on the range .
bottom line , this place sucks .
someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be .
very disappointed in the customer service .
we will not be back .
the iced tea is also terrible tasting .
used to go there for tires , brakes , etc .
plus , _num_ of the new tires went flat within _num_ weeks .
terrible .
i was originally told it would take _num_ mins .
slow , over priced , i 'll go elsewhere next time .
so frustrated .
never going back .
they seem overpriced , too .
do n't waste your time .
not a call , not the estimate , nothing .
shortly after returning home she started to cough and gag like .
she was very uncomfortable .
at this point they were open and would be for another hour .
wait _num_ hrs .
she has to wait _num_ days to be seen .
absolutely the worst care in all my experience with vets !
this place went from great to horrible .
absolutely no problems .
noisy snow tires in the summer !
i told him they are too noisy .
very rude and once they get paid have no ethics .
i dropped off _num_ shirts at this establishment just before thanksgiving .
they have offered $ _num_ a shirt for the shirts they lost .
i would n't use their services again if you paid me to .
sign is blank and all fixtures from the store have been removed .
bread or not , it still was n't great .
it was a basic salad , no big deal .
i never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be .
nah ... why bother when there are so many other options around .
just do n't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds .
but apparently , mama has left the kitchen .
as for my mushroom and cheese omelette , the cheese was lacking .
if i wanted a microwave omelet i would have gone to burger king .
two scrambled whole eggs , italian toast , and home fries .
in a considerably nasty tone .
trash .
guess who was n't too busy , carnegie coffee company down the street .
nothing special .
it was hot in there and i do n't think they have ac .
it does n't say cash only anywhere inside or on the menu either .
there is an atm , but it has a $ _num_ charge to use .
ca n't believe a place in _num_ does n't take cards .
the coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate .
i fed my whole family breakfast ( _num_ of us ) for $ _num_ .
not to mention my allergies were in full effect .
the bathroom was so inconvenient to get in and out of .
breakfast was pathetic .
i 'll be sure to spend my money elsewhere next time .
if i could give this place less than one star , i would .
apparently , we were out of luck .
it 's a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs .
no more smoking allowed .
same lousy service .
i really really want this place to do better .
we need more irish pubs and local old time watering holes .
whatever the case , they have cold guinness .
some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
we used a coupon from the paper for a _num_ topping _num_ cut sicilian .
the onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can .
it was gross .
the veggies were old and wilted , and there was no dressing on either .
no flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam .
i have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed .
what a mistake .
the business is not run the way it has been in the past .
this is probably the worst business in carnegie .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
the inside is very dated and appears to be poorly cared for .
it smelled like burnt fish when we walked in the door .
the fish was old and cold and fries were a very soft .
the corn lacked butter .
service was n't too bad - nice people .
unfortunately , there are only two reviews .
they did not acknowledge me .
the door i was at had signage ( open hours ) .
take it from me ; avoid this place at all cost .
does n't even taste good as american style chinese food .
i used to order takeout here once every month or so .
let alone one that the food is n't even that good .
also the inside is dirty as heck .
needless to say , we never returned .
otherwise i 'll have to have him put to sleep .
do n't take your cat here .
do n't waste your time or money at this denny 's .
i never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members .
i did n't feel welcome here .
but it 's not well maintained .
terrible service .
but my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit .
but it was n't just the knowledge of the menu .
there was no one filling up water .
my biggest complaint , however , is what happened with our meals .
so , he took the meals back to the kitchen .
they did n't remake anything .
quite frankly , the fish was n't good at all .
the guy never really even apologized for the mistake .
coming here you get the feeling they have n't changed much .
does that make you a little worried ?
ambiance , like i said , left much to be desired .
consider where this place is , the prices are really really high .
nothing is served on the side with main dishes ... .
papa j 's is expensive and inconsistent .
there are better restaurants in carnegie .
it was so disgusting i could n't eat it .
ugh .
not a ton of flavor there either .
his broccoli was rock hard - like wood !
and the chicken was very dry .
i have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times .
i wo n't go back .
the first time we were there almost _num_ hours .
ridiculous .
if it were up to me i would have never returned .
unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight .
my food was cold and bland , my kids food was cold .
bad food , slow service and rude managers .
papa j 's is no longer the only game in town .
obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management .
appalling !
my husband & i ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time .
my lettuce was drowning in the vinegar .
my husband 's pasta had even less flavor than mine .
we ate about a quarter of the food & could n't even finish it .
and i hate wasting food !
do n't waste your time eating here .
there are much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh .
well , papa j 's has officially priced itself out of our budget .
$ _num_ per salad ?
it 's lettuce , cheese , and pine nuts !
$ _num_ / salad ?
our pizza was cold and our drinks where empty .
we are not going back .
it rather looks like a deli counter .
a bit confusing layout , but tastefully done .
the dining area is brighter than the rest of the restaurant .
there was no salad or pasta side offered .
this alone i would have given _num_ stars .
annoying ?
confused ?
he appeared to have no idea what he was doing half the time .
however , i think i would try somewhere else to dine .
why the hell was there a wait ?
the older man that took us to the table could have done nicer .
the food was not bad but it was not good .
the chicken piccata was flavorful , but not as expected .
it had no signs of being coated and sauted to a rich golden brown .
no pasta was served with the chicken .
the side of vegetables were well cooked , buy again lacked any real flavor .
the total was $ _num_ and change .
my friend ordered veal and they brought him sausage .
the waitress was extremely rude .
too many good restaurants in that area to tolerate bad attitude !
that is where the efficiency and service took a turn for the worst .
we sat for _num_ minutes before a server came to our table .
at that point , she said i 'll grab you water and bread .
however , we ordered the veal stuffed banana peppers which arrived cold .
we also ordered the `` incredible white pizza '' which was incredibly cold .
while patrick stepped up the service the entire experience was fairly terrible .
also , i wrote to the restaurant and received no response .
for $ _num_ a person it was terrible .
i got the shrimp and veal and my veal was dry .
i ordered a drink _num_ times and never got it .
i 'll probably never go back again .
worst service of all time .
place is a total joke .
the last visit i overlooked the $ _num_ gnocchi special .
okay , shame on us for not asking .
potatoes or pasta are always included with marsala .
never ever again will we return here .
not us .
just so rude .
the worst dental experience of my life .
i have never been so uncomfortable in my life .
save yourself a lot of time , money and pain .
no one should have to go thru what i am currently going thru .
the worst dental office i ever been .
you should avoid it at any time .
would not have my dogs teeth cleaned here !
this place is one of the worst dental offices i 've ever walked into .
i 've never posted a yelp review before .
no sign of italian meat to be found .
no marinara sauce .
you may want to consider having the pizza delivered .
my expectations for mcdonalds are t rarely high .
the cashier took my friends 's order , then promptly ignored me .
the manager was rude when giving me my order .
i 've eaten at various mcdonalds restaurants for over _num_ years .
this mcdonald 's is so bad it 's amazing .
order : big mac , large fries , diet coke .
the soda machine was broken .
no sodas .
left with : big mac , medium fries , no coke .
there 's nothing to see here .
poor customer service .
worst mcdonalds i have ever been to .
last time i went chicken nuggets were under cooked .
people were getting refunds wait time was so long .
soda is watered down and gross .
rude staff doesnt know what they are doing .
just skip this one and you will be better off .
seating inside is very limited .
i 'm not a huge fan of this location .
and there 's hardly any tables to sit at .
this has never happened before and it took me off guard .
the barista came off dishonest and unfriendly with the up sell push .
i will avoid this one at the waterfront for awhile .
with all of the other options in the area , take your money elsewhere !
finally , i find one after _num_ minutes of wondering around .
this is not the first time i 've been hard up to find help .
the store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere .
however , if you 're looking for something specific , good luck .
i usually only stop there if i 'm already at tend waterfront .
not at this location .
this is the absolute worst steak n shake i 've ever been to .
the bf and i got lost around pittsburgh for _num_ min .
wish i had looked it up earlier .
the only thing worse than the food is the service .
there were several things that got me annoyed , one after another .
but the food came cold .
we were so hungry by that point , we just ate whatever we could .
neither angel nor anyone else came to top up our drinks even once .
might have been a stomach bug but it is kind of strange .
terrible wait staff could n't even seat us .
def not worth the wait .
i really like the chili .
burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad .
pretty hard to mess up a side salad .
as others have said you never know what kind of service you will get .
store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair .
cheap and crap service .
unfortunately the service is very hit or miss .
the service is awful .
the service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service .
i sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared .
it was all i could taste .
tonight they told me that the drive thru was closed .
i have never , ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom .
this one , however , leaves a lot to be desired .
most of the time , they 're downright rude .
dirty and slow .
this location is terrible .
the drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food .
she then told me it only comes with cheese .
so i then went on to tell her what i wanted on my burger .
the meat is badly burned and cold .
it was clear to me this burger was not fresh .
the service is the worst i 've ever seen .
i do n't know how corporate keeps this place open .
i 've complained numerous times but it never does any good .
take the extra _num_ minutes to drive to the south hills location .
food is cheap but portions are small .
also the restaurant is not really clean either .
this restaurant is not my number _num_ choice .
i really do n't know how this place stays open .
on our last visit it took us _num_ minutes to get our waitresses attention .
it took _num_ minutes to get the mustard and mayo .
just bad service .
our waitress was very polite , though .
i have eaten here before and never had any problems .
they completely ignored us so we got up and left .
one table near us had to flag a waitress just to get her attention .
slow service .
food is very cheap though .
i would go here if the service was faster and better .
slow .
still no food .
we were a party of _num_ adults and _num_ kid .
i 've worked at steak n shake before .
it less than _num_ minutes to cook both the burgers and fries .
the manager here needs better training .
i waited _num_ minutes for charred hamburger .
however they ( waitresses ) were nice and apologetic .
could n't believe the waitress thought it was okay to serve .
waitress was rude to them and the manager never came to address the issue .
terrible customer service .
five guy burgers much better .
this is the worst place i 've maybe ever been to .
the outside was filthy with trash all over .
the inside was maybe worse , trash and dirty .
the employees were awful , rude , slow and not caring about a thing .
i ca n't even guess how unsanitary it might be .
disgusting .
i keep forgetting how not good this location is .
i only returned because i was getting my dog groomed at the nearby petco .
actually there was nothing basement like about it .
what will be done with the empty space that is the question ?
$ _num_ for a red bull and vodka ?
in my opinion , sing sing is really not worth it .
lame .
lame as heck .
the music the guys played was all stuff from like _num_ .
i would not recommend anybody go .
this place has gone significantly down hill .
however , each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller .
very slow and boring .
save your $ _num_ and skip this place .
we had reservations , which was good because it was packed that saturday night .
why should it , those computers are always making mistakes .
what was originally an average lowe 's has turned into lowe 's hell .
we would be paying several hundred dollars to get the doors installed .
after the installation , lowe 's would refund us the $ _num_ .
i told him we would like our $ _num_ back .
i can not believe how unprofessional this store was !
goodbye lowes ... hello home depot !
what a shame !
so much rudeness -- checking out and trying to find other items .
clearly there are zero expectations for customer service here .
our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that .
the potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing .
if you are going to order something , i would go with the pizza .
we also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good , also .
she sent it back .
no quick and easy app or beers on the house .
to boot , the beer was pretty expensive .
the biggest downfall of duke 's , though , is the food .
the first was flavorless and cold .
the second was passable , but nothing special .
and the last were absolutely awful .
i ate two of the _num_ tenders ( seven ! )
_num_ strikes .
i gave up and refused the offer for another .
i felt bad just ordering free beer so i ordered a sandwich .
bar staff not so much this visit .
we were ignored until i grabbed a table in the back .
neither of us were n't very happy about this .
menus for drinks and food have no prices .
$ _num_ for a banana split cocktail ?
waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts .
trying to get something healthy , i ordered the apple pecan salad .
i could barely eat the salad .
perhaps next time we 'll just stop by for drinks instead .
i guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene .
the food was absolutely gross !
first of all the sandwich was on sliced bread ( lame ) !
gross !
mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location .
the food is crap .
this time , it was ridiculous .
on top of that , the customer service sucked .
for $ _num_ , it was n't worth it .
mediocre service .
cold food !
our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted .
bland food .
_num_ beer per hour maximum .
avoid at all costs .
here 's where it gets bad .
_num_ mins later we get our refills .
mind you , our food still has n't came yet .
i was frustrated .
finally , _num_ mins later ... that 's one hour , folks .
yep , the food was cold .
the only compensation we got were $ _num_ game cards .
waitress never apologized .
after spending over $ _num_ plus games , we will never go back .
it was a saturday !
_num_ bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full .
all i have to say is get your crap together .
for how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends .
apathetic service staff all around , the peanut and i were really disappointed .
wo n't be back .
let me tell you about my bad experience first .
what the hell !
i was just really turned off from that experience .
lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people !
i will not be back again to eat .
the outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste .
the fish itself was bland .
i was thinking he would have stopped but did n't oh well .
sometime you just get one that is n't .
this place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms .
when our food came though , everything was below average .
did n't see a manager until after 10:30 pm .
needless to say , we did n't stay to eat and went elsewhere .
it 's the customers fault your staff ca n't handle a sat night rush .
i will never spend money here again !
awful awful .
took _num_ minutes to even be acknowledged .
wrong !
first off , service was horrible .
it took about _num_ minutes , minimum , to get our first drinks .
my boyfriend had their philly cheesesteak and he could n't finish it .
was so salty and just not good .
for the price of everything , it was not worth it all .
you 'll save $ $ , time , and frustration !
everything was pretty picked over , which kinda sucked .
so we again go off in search of someone to help .
it also was n't the cleanest place i 've ever seen .
and not well maintained or managed at all .
over priced , over hyped but a hell of a time regardless .
i ate here for lunch today with my wife and _num_ kids .
server was prompt getting to the table , took our order and then disappeared .
grilled cheese , salad and a quesadilla should n't take that long .
mens room did n't have any paper towels to dry hands with .
huge fail for this type of venue .
service is n't too bad , but could be better .
i also thing d & b is n't the cleanest place either .
the bathrooms near the arcade are always nasty in my opinion .
does n't seem like they keep up with it .
to me , thats a big factor in rating restaurants .
this was n't the cleanest place .
dirty paper towels all over the women 's bathroom .
also they are n't following corporate policy .
very disappointed in his attitude more then anything .
the food here is awful .
i only gave it _num_ stars because i liked my mac and cheese .
everyone else at the table hated their food .
all i have to say is no thanks .
i 'd hate to be there when they are `` busy '' .
worst service i 've ever had !
we left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food .
no apologies nothing .
while sitting there we noticed _num_ other parties walked out as well .
they did n't even get their drinks .
i would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat .
the food was bad .
the bathrooms smelled like stale urine and the floors were very sticky .
the waitress was nice but overall i would n't dine here again .
if you are under _num_ you must be accompanied by a _num_ year old .
awful place with rude people .
this place has really gone down hill in the past 3-4 years .
we will not be going back !
if you are here to eat , maybe try somewhere else .
even managers saw us sitting there and didnt bother to greet us .
we will still go here just not try to eat .
i am _num_ and my sisters are younger than i am .
which i was , and i was not allowed in .
avoid eating or drinking anything here .
the service was terrible .
especially multiple employees , hostesses , waitresses , and bus boys .
either way , on a saturday night , i would n't recommend going here .
nina the manager and ashley the cashier extremely rude .
highly recommend that no one ever goes here .
our service was awful as well .
i do n't think i have one good thing to say about this place .
she brought a pile of beverage napkins .
but that 's not the worst .
despite pointing out the problem , she never did do anything about that .
anyway , do n't try to eat here .
just come and play the games , but skip the food .
i wish there were no kids .
she was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong .
how ridiculous for an arcade game company to turn away kids .
if they had a negative star would have selected the worst rating .
_num_ hour wait and then cold food served .
did not have enough staff in kitchen and never bothered to provide updates .
nothing positive to say other than do n't go there .
ghetto , the server kept calling me baby all night .
staff is rude .
waited _num_ minutes for our drinks and an additional _num_ minutes for our food .
i could understand if they were busy , but it was n't at all .
the food was n't very good at all .
i 've never sent back food , ever , but this was ridiculous .
the server takes my plate , and says they would make it right .
ca n't say much for an office that is managed this way .
the lack of empathy was even more disturbing .
do n't take it out on the person they are incorrectly calling .
the frosty is never frosty always runny .
`` nah '' it was _num_ .
guess not .
cant rate the food cause i have n't received any .
but since its _num_ guess they are closed .
if there was a way to give no stars i would .
horrible service .
so we called back and asked for our money back .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
not worth one star !
- original pretzel appetizer .
the half order of ribs looked like a full rack .
- lots of food choices ... burgers ... steak ... chicken ... salads .
lots of drink choices ... beers ... wines ... mixed drinks .
- none of the food was super awesome .
nothing was awful , but nothing stood out in any way .
- kind of dead on a monday night with 3/4 of the place empty .
head next door to sing sing for drinks , though .
the low point lately has been the food .
unfortunately rock bottom is one that falls into that category .
it 's pretty much a crap shoot .
unfortunately , it seems there is zero attention to food quality .
till then , it 's hit or miss !
i must admit , i do like the brews .
i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes .
other than that , meh .
the food is pretty forgettable .
not worth $ _num_ unfortunately the sausage platter was $ _num_ .
the restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table .
i have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable .
their food is pretty much like their beers , forgettable .
here 's where i ran into problems .
it was very greasy and had virtually no crab .
the service was ok , not the best not the worst .
if i was n't so hungry i would n't have eaten them at all !
the husband had the bbq chicken pizza .
it blew my crappy tacos out of the water !
and the underwhelming food sealed the deal .
poor service and food .
i waited _num_ minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence .
so i had to wait an additional _num_ minutes to find someone to pay .
on to the important part ... food was terrible .
i had a burger and it was pathetic .
otherwise , you are better off skipping it .
unfortunately the reality did n't match the idea of the burger .
it was like having a standard old boring burger .
i was very disappointed .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a lot more flavor .
but yes , you guessed it , that 's overpriced too .
the food was uninspired , tired , and ordinary .
spicy and thick it went down easy enough .
the steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of ... .
not the best dinner they have eaten .
it was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon .
over all this meal was a wash .
corporate decided to get rid of the core beers and the beers now suck .
the service has also suffered tremendously .
i do n't expect this rock bottom to be around too much longer .
i could not even finish half of mine .
if i were to go back , it certainly would not be to eat .
meh is the only thing i leave here feeling .
i ordered the classic burger because nothing on the new menu excited me .
it was topped with an olive and a mini pickle ... odd .
my `` squash '' side was lacking squash .
instead all squash was replaced by peppers ... which i can not eat .
very disappointing menu .
i 'm very disappointed to say this place has gone down hill .
every time we are seated in the dining area it 's a bad experience .
i tried to steal a few of his fries , which were a failure .
on my own dish i had the classic mac n ' chicken .
and when i say smothered here , this is not a good thing .
everything else , avoid .
first bad experience at this place .
double swiss burger was as tasteless as they could make .
i asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt .
instead of caramelized onions , they added raw onions .
the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay .
wo n't visit again .
overall , it was a mediocre experience with forgettable food .
i wo n't be going back .
my boyfriend 's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back .
very disappointed with this place .
do not come here to eat .
_num_ stars because the beer was good .
no salsa , no lettuce , guac , sour cream .
it was so underwhelming .
i wish the food could match the quality of their beer .
if you want rock bottom food , head to rock bottom .
slow service , horrible , horrible food .
was served freezing cold enchiladas and pizza .
terrible customer service , disrespectful in fact .
never going back again and i would advise against master muffler to all others .
second , the sodas are not free refills !
but the biggest problem is the food and drink .
_num_ - a lot of the drinks did n't have prices on them .
it 's not that hard .
_num_ - put the drink prices on the website too .
not all the prices are on the website , which makes for difficult planning .
the food , however , is mediocre at best .
i could not see a thing .
it was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl .
it looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked .
it was n't edible .
it does n't even have to be memorable ... just not offensive .
but damn , i was hungry !
i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole .
i 'd give the comedians _num_ stars , and the food zero stars .
no , i do n't want you to take our food back !
is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on ?
sadly , no .
the service did n't get any better .
the food was lousy .
one of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich .
but hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable .
we also sent an order of chicken fingers back ... dryer than sand .
overpriced , shitty food and drinks .
hell , tgi friday 's would have been better .
they did n't let people in because they claimed the room was not ready .
seating is first come , first served .
whoever designed this place should be shot .
there is no lobby to hold people before a show .
there is no question that it has everything you could want .
that 's where the praise ends .
and it 's not just coffee , and not just target .
they 're banking on this lack of competition .
now , maybe you do n't care .
they clearly do n't bring them in at the end of the night .
the lack of customer service in this regard is atrocious .
walmart does n't even make you do that !
this was an expensive skirt , completely ruined .
very disappointed .
just do n't take your dry cleaning here .
costco was closed so i went to giant eagle .
do n't waste your time , or risk your health .
go to any other pharmacy in town , avoid giant eagle .
went to barnes and noble waterfront with _num_ books on my list .
it 's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows .
i do n't remember her name which is usually not a good sign .
rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders .
so , i settled on the hummus appetizer .
all in all this place is n't that bad .
drinks were ordered and were unbelievably slow .
thanks for giving me one more reason never to come back .
bar louie : you are dead to me .
the place was near empty and there were three waitresses .
_num_ minutes later , our food and the bill arrived .
worst part ?
however , i gave this place two stars instead of one .
let me just say that this used to be a place i loved .
i ca n't say the food is bad .
i will say i still ate them so shame on me .
there were fruit flies everywhere .
because of number two our service in general was not good .
the _num_ of us got to bar louie at 8:30 .
i wo n't be going back .
i very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first .
outside of that bar louie leaves a lot to be desired .
to me , that is beyond ridiculous .
the absolute worst service i have ever had at any bar or restaraunt .
and , in looking at other reviews , i am not the first .
it was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing .
servers are chatting , not paying attention to tables .
worst serves ever .
it 's expensive , the food is so so .
skip it .
there were also plenty of empty tables .
this should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction .
the server was nice , that is not the issue .
the issue was how grossly understaffed they were .
our server , was friendly .
my husband had a margarita and my server suggested a berry mojito to me .
both drinks were overly sweet and barely any alcohol .
awful acoustics !
bobby and i came here after dinner and sat up at the bar .
maybe i 'm just salty about the wait .
not even a large one , either !
but good lord , they 're just so loud !
i always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard .
not cool , bar louie .
not cool .
food was _num_ out of _num_ for this type of bar / restaurant .
service was extremely poor and bar service was also extremely poor .
_num_ mins .
i wan na love bar louie , i do .
dip for the chips are cold and beer is room temperature .
the service is ok but rather slow .
he immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks .
only another _num_ minutes until he brought one martini over .
we originally sat upstairs , which was open per the sign .
the one other time that i had been there the service was so-so .
this is not one of them .
was seated for _num_ min and no wait staff came to take our order .
awkward .
the only other bartender was slowly walking around the other end of the bar .
we got up and walked out and will never be back .
worst bar i have ever been to .
she then disappeared for _num_ minutes before coming back to take a food order .
there is no excuse for the poor service and food .
the worst bar and the worst service in the area .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
please ... take your hard earned money elsewhere .
sat at the bar at about _num_ saturday for appetizers and drinks .
no offer to refill drinks or for water .
i made a reservation for _num_ on a saturday night .
the manager was rude .
nothing to rave about .
it was just ordinary .
all in all , this place just needs a bit of organization .
terrible service .
small flies flying around restaurant .
mortified by this , my wife and i quickly finished and left .
the drinks are very expensive but that 's every bar louie .
i spent almost _num_ minutes for some nachos .
skip this place if you do n't want to feel ill after dining .
you will have to spend $ _num_ on a parking pass .
there are just too many misses in my book though .
he pushed me and took all the chairs .
an adult area would change all this .
the weekdays are bad enough .
i 'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer .
the lazy river could be much better .
dont waste your time with this place .
long lines , overpriced and no shade or cooling spots while you wait .
you 're better off with a garden hose .
disgusted .
just sad there customer service sucks .
my sister for a deal for _num_ and day in the _num_ season .
i paid _num_ at my local giant eagle .
thats not really a big deal .
that is a downfall .
we did n't do the lay river however because the lines were ridiculous .
people are rude there as well .
some horse play and such .
$ _num_ locker .
i really hate this place .
all of this after very thorough instruction as to where to go .
just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong .
so after several more wrong turns we finally get home .
absolutely terrible night .
otherwise , i would suggest staying far , far away !
please do n't eat this food .
fried rice super bland .
chicken was slimy .
service was indifferent .
no repeat visit for me .
rice is a little plain but i just add some soy sauce .
general tso had no flavor .
not crispy at all assuming thats why it was so fast .
only reason i would go back is speed .
meh , i 've experienced better is an understatement .
somehow this restaurant gets packed and i never understand why .
i ordered a turkey burger with pickle and mustard .
waitress was supposed to go and get our next round of drinks .
disappointment .
so sad .
i order the jack daniel 's chicken and shrimp with just fries .
the chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer .
even the water tasted weird .
nothing special just around average !
went with _num_ others for a weeknight dinner .
i ordered a burger , which very overdone and dry .
the place was pretty dead and we were seated right away .
fridays seems to have gone down hill .
my burger was well done and dry .
i was sad to see how far down the quality of food had gone .
the wait staff did n't even acknowledge our party of _num_ .
my experience at this friday 's was not what i was expecting .
this beer is like champaign and it makes my whole stomach nice and cold .
why was my beer warm ?
better than that , why was my pot sticker appetizer in my beer ?
i did not find this funny at all !
i really do n't know why i bother with chain restaurants anymore .
when the salad arrived , it did not look like the picture .
it was disgusting .
not only was it disgusting , but it cost us about $ _num_ .
it was ok ... very mediocre .
i 'm sure there 's still a lot of room for improvement , however .
avoid this place !
i really never want to return .
food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side ass mashed potatoes .
the menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive .
but later the service was not all good .
bad bad service .
was very disappointed with the food .
how does this place still exist of every place on the waterfront !
possibly the worst overpriced pizza there is .
service was just barely adequate on this visit .
it sure is n't the food .
too much dressing in a salad that did n't even fill the bowl .
only in a pinch .
ca n't handle basic cleanliness then this is not a place to eat at .
we woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place .
it was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty .
it was ok but not something i would order again .
my husband 's salad , italian chopped , was better .
it had huge chunks of tomatoes , sausage , and cheese .
for something that took so long to get it should have been hot .
i managed one bite and was done .
what we came away with from this experience is to leave .
do n't try to stay when the experience is that bad .
interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already .
i understand , you ca n't try them all .
no one .
um , i 'm not asking you to help me sort things .
i 'm not holding up a line .
i have never felt more uncomfortable in a retail store before .
i have never visited a store with such a bad staff .
i hate this place .
our drinks and my soup came out immediately .
i did n't know what it was and did n't want to know .
i ate half the bowl and left the rest for the server .
it was thick and gooey and the flavor did n't wow .
i saw no reason to continue .
the skins were a bit thick and doughy .
we finished our dumplings .
this food , though , it was n't good .
i just do n't understand how anyone can like this place .
we tried going early , late -- it never made any difference .
the front staff was rude , and the wait was too long .
they could n't tell us when we would be seated .
after _num_ minutes we gave up .
i had the singapore rice noodles .
the fried rice was disappointing and the vegetables tasted raw .
sweet and sour chicken was just the same minus the kick .
the service was annoying .
there 's nothing really wrong with it .
the food is sooooo bland though .
last time we were there the server was horrendous as well .
it was really embarrassing and every time he came by the conversation died .
but it 's soooooo bland !
they were also playing _num_ year old pop music really loud .
come on -- this is an `` asian bistro . ''
i was extremely disappointed by the lack of presentation .
our party arrived about _num_ minutes before our 5:30 reservations .
however it was unprofessional of our waitress to pass buck .
i get there , look at their giant selection and get excited .
we sat at the bar and the female bartender was miserable .
we ordered drinks and she was unhappy that we did .
do not sit by the windows because it was very cold .
nothing was comped and no manager was available .
this pf changs needs new management !
it 's not worth the headache .
drinks were not good .
below par on every way .
the phone rang and she answered it as we stood at the door .
did n't say a word to us .
will not be back there -- rude hostess !
it 's fake asian food .
terrible experience !
very bad experience .
i started with a cup of their wonton soup .
on a scale of bad to good , it was kind of meh .
none at all .
never going back to pf changs .
the only thing this place has going for itself is the decor .
the service was not that professional !
the service was terrible .
we waited almost _num_ minutes for water glasses to be brought to the table .
when my dish comes out , it 's literally just steamed veggies and rice .
no tofu , no seasoning or sauce .
not going back .
not going to recommend it to anyone .
disappointing : ( i expected more out of pf chang 's .
would n't go back .
i you want chinese go to how lee , or china palace .
if i had to use one word to describe my experience : depressing .
when we got to the table , we were hoping for a better experience .
there were no complaints with the chicken , the only star of this evening .
the beef was disappointing to say the very least .
my only regret is i can not leave a 1/2 star rating .
it was bitter cold outside .
i asked our server why they had n't mentioned this when we came in .
i quickly ate and left to make my movie .
this is the second bad experience i 've had at this particular location .
i 'm not against p.f .
chicken was very tough .
my boyfriend ordered the hot fish , but it was way too salty .
not much more , but enough to make it not right .
instead , my total was about $ _num_ .
bottom line , enterprise ca n't be trusted .
not at this location , at least .
i 've had bad experiences here a few times now .
bad service all around !
really , you do n't get much for what you pay for at panera .
its not very good at all .
service here is pretty bad .
i ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup .
panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant i have ever been to .
it did not even look appetizing .
stopped by sunday morning .
the light roast coffee was cold .
the steak was ice cold .
the slice of tomato that i had them add was not ripe .
panera quality should be consistent no matter what location you visit .
very disappointing considering their pricing structure .
do not eat the pastries !
yuk , i said that 's disgusting people have to eat that .
she reluctantly gave me the owners name .
service here has gone considerably downhill .
needless to say , will be my last time going there .
i just felt i was rushed out of there .
am i the only one ?
target reminds me of hills when i was a kid .
my experience here was not great at all .
watch out when it looks like something is on sale .
white slim fit shirt looked ridiculous .
his jacket did n't fit and his white shirt was worse than mine .
he said , oh about $ _num_ or $ _num_ .
i 'm shocked , never thought men 's dress clothes were so pricey .
first of all , the store was messy .
okay , i get it , they work on commission , but seriously .
needless to say , she would n't leave us alone .
my husband said , i 'm looking for some dress shirts and pants .
if it would have been me alone , i would have walked out .
however , i knew my husband wanted to use the gift card .
i did n't get it .
continuing on , check out was a nightmare !
worst customer service .
it 's not that delish .
this store has such bad service .
the service staff are rude rude rude .
save your money , shop elsewhere .
i love bbb ; however , this location is terrible .
maybe they should pay me for this responsibility .
my gut just tells me not to trust e 'n ps .
so i wind up washing my hands after getting my salad stuff .
strawberry pies being the exception to the rule .
there are better places to eat for the same money .
ugh .
it seemed like every single employee was around _num_ years old .
the service was very slow .
my drink was never refilled .
basically the whole experience was pure torture , which is disappointing .
being next door to corporate you would have higher expectations .
the breakfast bar is lame .
the pumpkin creme pie looked like it was sliced by a _num_ year old .
if i remembered her name , i would definitely mention it in this review .
it 's a hit and miss .
this location though has horribly slow service .
it 's not .
does n't matter what time we go .
get your hosts and servers on the same page !
poor service from the door .
i walked in and was ignored .
possibly the worst dining experience i 've had .
no apology .
she simply said that sometimes they are n't told when someone is seated outside .
extremely slow service and a rude waitress on top of it .
this has to be the worst restaurant at the waterfront .
it is appalling to see what that place has become .
i will never go back to that place again .
unfortunately , that was the high point of this service .
the waitress there are extremely rude .
good cheap food .
horrible service .
had to wait _num_ minutes before our waiter to even acknowledge us .
he then was really rude and never gave us napkins or forks .
did n't get any refills .
the coffee was stale .
i recently went into this eat n park and had a horrible experience .
how can a restaurant not have proper seating for its paying customers ?
trying to eat `` fresh '' pineapple with no wine just breaks my heart .
much closer to bland than anything .
the meat was extremely bland , with very little seasoning .
i talked to the waitress and she offered to bring out another side .
i was highly disappointed in the service , and i only ordered take out .
no offer of water , or a drink .
_num_ staff members yelled .
she then rings me up .
when i go to eat my meal , utensils were not included .
very disappointing experience .
will not be returning .
not good .
not good .
this appetizer was recommended and was garbage .
why _num_ star ?
went there last night about 5:30 , the place was maybe half full .
sorry but not going back there again .
the service was mostly friendly but i was disappointed in my meal .
my meal was way over cooked .
had lobster bisque soup not to good .
the scallops were hard , over cooked .
shrimp had no flavor .
it took so long to get , we just left .
whoever gave this place _num_ or five stars must be out of their minds .
bad decision .
the chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes .
the crab cakes were definitely frozen , and not made from blue crab .
zero flavor and dry as hell .
stringy , asian crab that was definitely pre-made .
terrible .
very disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
however , the service we experienced was terrible .
good food , but i wo n't be in a hurry to go back .
first time in pittsburgh on biz and staying in the waterfront district .
too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry .
disappointed .
i gave it twice and no one bothered to contact me .
stay far away from this place .
what a disappointing easter dinner .
five minutes later the $ _num_ easter special came out .
he was very rude to us .
his poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday .
very disappointing .
the restaurant was about half full , i was with one other person .
chef 's special was penne in a light alfredo sauce with crab and shrimp .
it also was served at room temperature .
i had the scallops with stir fried vegetables .
the garnish had cheese on it the first time , not the 2nd .
penne was mediocre at best .
service -- - probably the worst service i 've ever had there .
never did get a refill on iced tea .
sorry to see this place go down hill .
may not ever go back .
will not eat here again .
party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something .
it was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste .
unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand .
the quality is completely gone , portions are smaller , prices higher .
the server even tried pushing a diners club program on us !
why would anyone even pay for such lousy food ?
the place is not even kept up anymore .
my silver was even wrapped in torn linens !
even the staff is miserable anymore .
i am sorry to say i did not get it .
i ordered the crab stuffed shrimp and was disappointed .
there were five very small shrimp on the plate .
the shrimp were dry and overcooked .
the crab stuffing was mostly stuffing .
i did n't see a piece of lump crab anywhere .
for the prices at this place , i had hoped for so much more .
i will not go back .
her reply `` no .
it was n't terrible , inedible food , it was just ... .
not good .
the only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice .
this is simply a customer service review .
_num_ minutes later we had still not been acknowledged .
gave it _num_ stars cause the wait staff was nice .
not even a ceiling fan in sight .
a few uninterested waiters wandering in back .
we finally just walked out to go elsewhere .
very bad purchase experience .
after further consideration , this store does not deserve a _num_ star review .
i do n't see to many options in pittsburgh for sporting goods .
i would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products .
this is an older dick 's sporting goods location .
these a holes .
glad they have plenty of shorts to buy when its _num_ degrees outside .
not surprisingly , we left without purchasing anything .
convenient bank hours though til _num_ pm .
no hi , no thank you , no have a nice day .
and i quickly remembered why !
forget the fact that mcdonald 's food is n't great .
we all know it 's not great .
... seriously , how does one even mess that up ?
world .
the owner has to be the problem .
worst mcdonald 's ever .
this review is more for the repair end of bbb .
where i am at , really there is no delivery but these guys did .
this crust , while thin , did not have flavor and was hard .
_num_ stars for being cheap and delivering .
the pizza , even when plain , is very greasy .
usually pizza that greasy is caused by low quality cheese .
also they do not take credit or debit cards .
there are better options .
when i started to eat , it tasted just as odd .
sorry allison b , ai n't no butter here .
sorry just had my first taste of pierogies plus .
the potatoes tasted very bland almost like dried mixed .
not my cut of tea .
unfortunately the food was n't very good .
i was served over cooked eggs with raw bacon and the biscuits were stale .
as far as i know they are no longer open at this location .
it was around 2:30 and empty .
the pork fried rice was actually pork burnt rice , nasty ( _num_ ) .
i also ordered boneless ribs , which were pretty good .
not a lot of fat on them .
menu is very basic .
the patty was sorta flavorful .
the toppings were in the bland category .
giant eagle is one of pittsburgh 's more expensive grocery chains .
management there does n't care !
visit another club , this one is n't it !
not good .
the service , on the other hand , was terrible .
avoid at all costs .
arrangement was just ok .
i will not order from this place again .
i would give our experience zero stars .
whatever it was , it was gross .
the chicken nuggets come out under par .
i recently posted a photo of my chicken ranch club .
that has no chicken .
this is ridiculous .
delivery is slow and not even close to the best chinese in the area .
try house of lee instead .
hands down , this was the worst we 've ever had .
but when it does , you bend over backwards to make it right .
not at this place .
too bad .
this family of _num_ wo n't be visiting china sea ever again .
leftovers .
the woman who answers the phone is kinda rude .
yes this is also a con because i threw it away .
just very greasy , very salty , poor excuse for chinese takeout .
i was hung up on twice before i could even get my order out .
that 's why i gave it two stars instead of one .
if you have any common sense at all , please do n't stay here .
do not stay here .
horrible !
i ca n't even rate this place !
i was forced to stay a night here and it was so disgusting !
i woke up with bed bug bites all over my body !
bed bugs would n't believe me i had to show my bite marks .
off to star nails we went .
unfortunately , the good feelings did n't last long .
i hate to rate a local shop down , but man my toes hurt .
i was rushed out and my polish was n't even hard yet .
while the place itself looked clean , the stylist 's rolling cart was not .
if i could give negative stars , i would .
terrible !
ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around _num_ o'clock .
worst fast food i 've ever been to .
after taking her to another vet , i was educated about wound care .
after she was treated properly , she healed quickly .
he cried constantly when i left his sight .
hoping to get a different vet next time i took my other cat there .
you try holding a scared cat in a room full of dogs .
my pet 's annual visit was over well $ _num_ .
also , do not take their facebook page seriously .
they do not care about animals .
disgusting .
i am not changing my review nor am i removing it .
they do not care about animals , at all .
this vet is only out for the money .
an average price , i 'm ok with that .
i think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients !
i could n't believe it .
this place is the worst , and i have never even stepped inside !
i needed a cut so i went for it anyway .
pie looked it it was sitting out for a day or _num_ .
i will not return to this place again .
shame on you lincoln to run a bakery like this .
almost all of the tires sold on site are foreign .
i 'm sorry , but you get one star for that .
i ended up buying american tires for the same price elsewhere .
everytime i eat at this location i end up with a sick stomach .
i do n't have that problem at other arby 's .
it was even slightly cold before i reheated it .
neither the brown sugar bacon and beef nor the blt had much bacon .
for a sandwich advertised to have delicious bacon , this fell way short .
the little bit of bacon it did have was burnt .
overall , this made a horrible day worse .
based on this experience , i would not go back .
based on this experience , i would most definitely not recommend this to others .
this store sucks beyond belief !
second of all , and more important , the service here is terrible .
you 're not doing as any favors by staying here .
first , i 'll walk you through my experience .
the customers and the staff are miserable at red white and blue .
the clothes are priced far higher than other such shops .
nasty !
do n't waste your time or money !
there are much better places to shop for thrift in pittsburgh !
i have never been treated so terrible in my whole life .
deciding not to get it , i placed it on a near by shelf .
i handed it to her and walked out .
i do n't shop at stores that hire such terrible staff .
they really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room .
just so bland !
my boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich , which he loved .
i however , ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed .
the pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible .
when i picked up the sandwich grease poured from it .
needless to say i do n't think i will be returning .
this place is overpriced and the service is not good at all .
not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby .
we will not be back .
if i could give dr. murphy less than _num_ star , i absolutely would .
the new dentist could n't believe that !
do not go here -- find another dentist .
not a fan .
tonight , we walked in and went up to the counter with our beer .
no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
it was a weird experience .
i had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer .
the owner was rude and did not even apologize for the horrible service .
do not take your dog there to be groomed !
at our table and then left prior to ordering .
bad idea .
what a disappointment !
evening started pretty badly and did not get much better .
we had reservations for _num_ people at 7pm this past saturday .
two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess .
when the rest of our group arrived ( on time !
she told me it would be awhile .
fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks .
service was rough .
long waits and lack of attentiveness .
not sure pino 's will get a repeat visit .
bland food and poor service .
there were no open tables , despite having reservations .
no such luck , since it was prime dining time on saturday night .
pino then literally threw our menu 's at us , and walked away .
not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience .
the food here is ok but not worth the price .
$ _num_ a glass of garbage wine ?
$ _num_ dollars for a plate of pasta , really ?
went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition .
i probably will not return .
listen folks , it 's cold when the sun goes down .
our server was nice , but not attentive at all .
the worst part of the night ?
needless to say , we were disappointed .
the place has changed and not for the better .
though the food was adequate , it 's not the same .
sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment !
we chose an option for each course of the very limited restaurant week menu .
baked eggplant caprese : the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess .
i do n't know where all the positive reviews are coming from .
there was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way .
all of it was overpriced and below mediocre .
i wasted my money , and i will never , ever go back there .
i do n't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother .
well , i have never felt more embarrassed in a situation .
i said he was being rude to my mother , a paying customer .
sorry , how can you not have $ _num_ in change ?
very disappointing meal .
salad was average at best .
he kept loudly requesting a credit card and the women did not have one .
after my visit last night , i have no desire to ever go again .
at this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter .
i could n't finish my dinner i was so mad .
sorry , we will never step foot in here again .
probably one of the worst places i have been to recently .
i wo n't be going back .
after _num_ minutes , i left .
when make turns , there is noise from front wheel .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
take a hard right down aisle _num_ and then you hit the bakery .
_num_ . )
from the bakery , you walk along a long meat wall .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
you 're not going every which way to try and find things .
the set up is ridiculous .
at night it is a nightmare .
ugh .
walked out without making purchase .
it was like a window into hell .
i will never step foot in that store again .
some are very slow .
the customers do n't make the experience any better .
_num_ cents .
avoid .
employees are unhelpful and rude .
i wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy .
_num_ minutes later , we were done .
yes , just like a bad date , we were done in _num_ minutes .
it was messy .
terrible !
the cut was terrible !
i have an awful experience .
the eggplant was soggy and not great .
price : tasty is cheap .
atmosphere : typical chinese takeout place .
would i go back again ?
there 's zero ambiance , offers quick take-out and the service is rude .
i ordered the kung pao chicken and crab rangoon .
sadly , they prepared kung pao beef instead .
it 's extremely disappointing to receive the wrong food .
it 's even more disappointing when the restaurant refuses to correct the order .
tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold .
not tasty at all .
never received my order and was left in a bad mood .
the sweet and sour chicken was disgusting .
it was a neon pink color and tasted like dried out chewy dog food .
there 's $ _num_ down the drain .
i wish there was a zero star option to give .
first off , everything was dripping everywhere .
the entire bag was a soggy mess .
i 'm not even sure they bothered to cook that .
next up , the `` general tso 's bean curd . ''
the only thing they did n't mess up on our order was the rice .
it tasted and looked like rice .
holy bat balls did this place have bad food !
nothing but flavorless , americanized chinese food .
very kind , gave me minor changes without question .
zero flavor , zero filling , frozen wan tons ?
they most certainly sat in broth for hours .
i could n't even pick them up .
they fell apart .
watery sauce , no heat .
just bad .
the worst part of it all .
see pics of giant balls of noodles that tasted like the burnt curry .
price does n't matter to me at all , though .
it was just inedible .
all noodle , no filler .
avoid if you want anything but americanized junk food .
unfortunately i did not get to experience these things .
the service was slow and lukewarm .
also , no credit or debit cards here .
i also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good .
i 've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad .
the crust is not homemade , pretty sure .
it was n't very hot either .
i am definitely going elsewhere next time .
this place has the worst service i 've ever seen .
i called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be _num_ mins .
i had to leave without my order after _num_ minutes .
very inconvenient in a world where cash is pretty much on the way out .
they lost my breakfast business that day .
worst pizza i have had in my entire _num_ years of life .
tasted like sauce and cheese on toast .
i would n't eat this pizza if it was free .
this was one of the worst dinners out i 've had in recent memory .
olive garden seems like fine dining compared to this place .
not the crusty italian bread .
no dipping oil with herbs and spices .
it was _num_ % breading .
i can barely taste any calamari or zucchini .
again , no herbs and spices .
for the entree , i ordered rigatoni and my fiance had baked ziti .
i could n't even taste garlic in it .
what kind of italian food has no garlic ?
service was slow , but there was only one waitress in the restaurant .
she was generally nice and probably embarrassed for serving such crappy food .
$ _num_ , including tip .
even with this voucher i feel like i paid too much money .
this shell station is horrible .
_num_ ) this place is ghetto .
why not ? ''
it 's frustrating because they also do n't particularly need to work hard .
zero effort , and a horrible attitude .
it 's a gas station , how hard can it be ?
it 's clear that they do not care at all .
i 'm never going back , and you should n't either .
do not use their car wash .
this was a big mistake .
horrible experience .
i was rear ended at a stop sign , was n't my fault .
i would n't recommend them to anyone .
called two days later to confirm it was ready .
`` no , it 's not ready yet .
days passed and no call .
left and halfway home , `` check engine '' light came back on .
please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards .
so now i have a very sick kitten on my hands .
poor little guy .
this also ruins my plan of getting another cat in the future .
bad shelter !
no `` i 'm sorry . ''
they kill more pets for space than any other pittsburgh shelter .
weak leadership .
this is a terrible shelter .
that 's probably how they got so sick !
my poor baby went through hell .
never again will i take my dog there .
she was sick six ways to sunday .
i hate that place and everyone in it .
i 'm very disappointed .
so i have no gripe with the tailoring itself .
so beware , you are paying to dollar !
i was in a time crunch , so paid anyways .
my suit coat came back ruined !
at that point , i had n't put two and two together yet .
so i went back first thing the next day , and showed the tailor .
it makes no sense .
i 'm just not crazy about the vibe here .
let me repeat , never again .
the primary reason i used to visit this store was to fill medical prescriptions .
hence , i am now here , writing this review .
the times i 've been here , its been an ok experience .
however , their store hours are absolutely terrible .
this place is a disaster .
it 's almost been _num_ hours and i 'm still waiting .
ridiculous .
-they did not install tires correctly .
booked an appointment , and they fixed the issue .
i do not recommend .
last time i ever set foot in that place .
i will not be returning in the future .
went in to have a slow leak fixed on a tire .
no one could look at it because they had an appointment at _num_ .
one person working and could n't look at my car .
no appointments available for tomorrow .
fail !
poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own .
was trying to find a rating lower than _num_ star but could n't .
this guy seems nice but he 's actually not .
something does n't sound right here .
the light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy .
the people who work here are very rude .
i am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there .
i will not go back again .
a little pricey but whatever .
the sandwich was just gross .
the coffee was just a little off .
no wonder mine was stale .
seriously , all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment .
their sandwiches taste terrible as well , they 've always been terrible .
seriously , fuck this place .
i just do n't get why the floor is like and ice skating rink .
i drink this beer regularly , and something was wrong with the beer .
i 've had the pork nachos and they were blah .
our server was friendly , but not terribly attentive .
i would probably only go again on an all-you-can-eat wings night .
i ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions .
it is a shame because buffalo blues does have potential .
the sandwich left something to be desired .
buffalo blues was neither .
not particularly interested in returning for any reason .
very classy , wish i could remember her name .
bar food none too exceptional .
we had nachos that were on slightly stale chips .
it was humongous but not that tasty , pretty dry .
bad texture .
it really is a pittsburgh staple but come on ... .
food is really , really average .
it , technically is in shadyside so your mercedes will be safe !
it 's loud as hell !
there seems to be no consideration for customers at all .
but as long as they got their money ; they could give a crap .
want to sit in the bar area ?
also it 's loud as hell !
to put it lightly ; the staff suck !
it pains me to leave any tip for them .
it is way too expensive .
oh how the mighty have fallen .
something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad .
since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable .
food is very overpriced though .
and , its not good .
some of the salads are alright , but its just not good food .
we did n't eat anything so i ca n't comment on the food .
my husband and i went to buffalo blues last night .
after what seemed like forever , my husband got up to find a server .
he literally walked around the restaurant to find someone , but could n't .
when we said no she said she would be back .
such a waste of time .
i hate this place .
so the max you could eat is _num_ wings .
the wings do not come with celery .
apparently this was a bad choice .
however , i hate it because i believe the alcohol and food is overpriced .
so , it 's not really much of a win at all .
unfortunately , the service we were given ruined our overall experience at buffalo blues .
my husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap .
the restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar .
we will not be back .
the food was awful , the service worse .
we ate two each , then told the server we did n't want them .
at least the place was quiet -- there were empty tables everywhere .
and the quality of them are bad .
unfortunately every time i wish i was somewhere else .
the hot and sour soup was ok.
this is an average chinese buffet .
and it all is so bad .
the chicken in the chicken and broccoli was so small and it looked disgusting .
the sweet and sour chicken looked like drops of hard , fried batter .
came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot .
they said it would take another two hours to start work .
i came in with a flat .
so no , no thank you .
they fixed the flat no problem for $ _num_ .
guess that cracking was n't so bad after all .
you should always have your car washed , specially in the winter .
i was quoted $ _num_ for them to get it off .
avoid this shop .
but after what happened i will never be back .
they just cost me money and lost my tires .
put the tires in my basement , no problem .
they call me up and tell me the tire is the wrong size .
because you could n't fit me in within a day i get screwed ?
every single time i go through the drive-thru i do n't get a straw .
i do n't know how this keeps happening .
i do n't think i 've ever encountered such a miserable bunch of people .
too bad after all these prior good reviews .
extremely rude and condescending over the phone .
unfortunately , i hung up feeling like a major inconvenience .
the sad part about this is they really try .
do n't expect great performances here , expect a talked up mediocre performance .
this apple is too green to eat much less pay for .
my pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright .
i also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake .
while i 've been to better bakeries , i will definitely be back .
if that does n't work , then they try to scare you w/ it .
or the fact that you 'll save sooooo much money by being a member .
granted , it was a friday morning , but still .
and nobody smiled at anyone else .
as i said above : it 's worse than the bureau of motor vehicles .
unbelievable .
it 's been a tremendous ordeal to get it fixed .
another employee tried to help me fix it and screwed that up too .
i do n't quite trust anybody else to help me properly .
there is no option for zero stars so i was forced to give one .
_num_ weeks later , no title ?
for some odd reason , local aaa offices dont post their phone number online ?
naturally , i get an automatic voicemail .
and again naturally , no return phone call .
cant wait until aaa calls me to renew my membership .
if i could give negative stars i would .
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
if i could give negative stars i would .
i should know , i 've dealt with at least a dozen .
times , and it still is not resolved .
why did you return there if you were so unhappy , you might ask .
if you are in the aaa , you 'll know i 'm calling .
worst experience .
slow , rude , unhelpful , and completely clueless .
my soul purpose to coming here was to get my license picture taken .
not here .
complete waste of life .
going through aaa is a bit worse than your average dmv .
the guy who processed our registration was patronizing and slow .
he also made a mistake that required fixing after the fact .
i called aaa and the service and follow-up were both appalling !
so the air in tire was wasted time .
no one has gotten back to me yet .
horrible treatment .
bad facility , even without a trash can in the room .
i never seen such a rude person in this county so far .
seems like she do n't wanted to take care of the customers .
place was a little bit of a disaster .
its easy to be dissatisfied and rant about a customer services organization .
so i drove _num_ hours there on a weekend to renew .
having a _num_ hour drive wasted didnt make it any better as well .
sad to say the other reviews i read of this place are accurate .
there were zero other people here aside from my friend and i .
fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things .
i feel bad for the lady that works the paint counter .
i 'm certain they notice , they just do n't care .
i came away with none of it .
the staff i dealt with could not have cared less about helping me .
do n't care .
very disappointing to me .
the customer service at this location is terrible .
overall , shopping there is a poor experience .
fairly mediocre , even by the relatively modest standards of home depot .
tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency .
fail .
i really like this shop .
all the sales associates are extremely useful and educated .
avoid this place .
the employees are nice but i get the sense it 's managed terribly .
it is difficult to get in and out of their lot as well .
they hired people that had to be required to do certain areas correctly .
terrible dry cleaners !
poor customer service .
i will never go there again , and i recommend you do n't either .
they do not take pride in their work .
they also lose things , more than once .
do not take your clothes there because they will damage or lose them .
simply awful !
as promised , they were ready monday after 5pm .
additionally , they did not smell so well .
the worst $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
avoid at all costs !
they 've ruined my clothes on _num_ separate occasions !
i want you to know i 'm not just an `` angry customer '' .
instead of _num_ .
very rude and condescending .
but we did n't have that problem until we left their lot !
and then there was another lady that was complaining about their service too .
do not take your car to midas !
they place no value on customer satisfaction .
furthermore i week later i found my car 's belt system was broken .
i made an appt online for 6pm the following day .
he said no because we didnt discuss it .
seriously how to you mess up a simple oil change appt in multiple ways .
- the usual crap they sell to people because they think they are idiots .
refused all of those .
seriously just do n't do it .
had a _num_ am appointment and was told it would be a hour wait .
the front desk clerk said that it should not be much longer .
slow service and response .
linda is a quite arrogant woman with bad attitude .
not recommend .
provolone sticks arrived undercooked , cheese was fully solid , they tasted okay .
worst pizza i 've had in pittsburgh .
i felt sick before i got halfway through it .
that reminds me - the slices are huge , and are $ _num_ .
sounds like the menu and staff needs to be updated .
i also should have known that i should n't have cheated on my diet .
not sure what on the salad made me feel this way .
but i 'm not liking the effect i 'm getting right now .
i got a chicken noodle soup and he got the seafood calzone .
to say the least , i was disappointed in my soup .
but their pizza was remarkably terrible .
i pay my $ _num_ and wait .
i could n't stand to eat more than half .
went home , made some eggs , and guess what ?
the terrible cheese taste from an hour and a half ago ?
i 'm not making this up .
terrible pizza .
just plain gross .
the crust was all gummy and the cheese tasted like plastic .
gross , gross , gross .
the crust was hard and flavorless .
this was a mistake .
avoid this place at all costs .
never again ... .
how utterly disgusted i was with it .
i spent days on the toilet after eating the pizza .
my appointment was at 8:30 am , i was on time .
i sat in the waiting room until _num_ am .
i waited _num_ mins in the lobby .
not cool !
now i am forced to put in another quarter to finish my load .
and at least i put my cart back .
now it 's just more expensive .
worst parking lot in pittsburgh .
try $ _num_ , for real .
waste of time and money overall .
parking at this particular store is a nightmare .
you treat the employees like dogs - like one level above dirt .
oh whole foods , you are so so very overpriced .
but i just can not bring myself to do my normal grocery shopping here .
you may even get a nasty look , yikes !
okay , i 'm going to a negative place right now ... .
even though i was only there one time , first impressions are a bitch !
the food : plentiful and too expensive to even think of buying .
all i got was a chopped up piece of crap that was useless .
i 'll stick with trader joe 's for my alternative market , thank you !
it really does n't hit you , until it ... hits you .
it 's why they have parking lots in the first place .
i 'll be honest , i just do n't get it .
i spent a lot , but i was ok with the occasional splurge .
not cool .
overpriced and overwhelming .
i made the mistake of going -- once -- on a weekend .
maybe i 'm just not the kind of person that likes whole foods .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
then told me it probably did n't start because it was sitting so long .
yeah , that sounds like `` nothing 's wrong '' .
do not bring your car here .
i spoke with brian at the desk who was very polite and professional .
sunday went by then monday went by .
then i had to pay them $ _num_ to get my suv back .
i had to pay them to waste my time and do nothing !
this was not in the lease .
_num_ ) they did not return my $ _num_ security deposit .
they never reached out to me , not once !
i would caution against this rental company .
i 've basically been told i 'm not getting my security deposit back .
that 's not a life i 'm comfortable with .
wish me luck guys .
ridiculous policies and move out fees .
please take all of these negative reviews seriously because they are valid .
they do everything they can to charge you extra fees .
the management is horrible and never understanding .
hot & sour soup was highly americanized , not very hot or very sour .
did they use the tea pot as an ash tray ?
cigarettes are not a replacement for tea bags !
the current tenant informed me that the roof leaked .
we just turned around and walked out at that point .
i would give him a _num_ start rating .
have you seen the terrible bathroom wallpaper borders ?
the wine list did not include descriptions .
disappointing .
the waitress was very curt and disrespectful .
overall , i just was n't very impressed with the food .
there was no information about this .
food is mediocre at best !
they even screwed my order .
asked for risotto and got some pasta , not sure what .
would not recommend to anyone .
they have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly !
i do n't get it .
i am upset to report that this tasted rather bland .
i am sad to report that this too was tasteless .
the ricotta was dumped on top and added nothing to the dish .
more frustrating than conversations with the wall .
total waste of $ _num_ bucks .
also , their bar seating sucks .
i ca n't believe all the high reviews .
the food tasted terrible .
if you like casbah more power to you but for me never again .
bill was $ _num_ without tax -- pricey by my standards for this experience .
the new tuna tartare appetizer was the highlight of our night .
we were disappointed with our entrees .
my roasted duck breast with spinach and gnocchi was not hot .
not a good vegan experience .
i again had offended by my request .
overpriced , salty and overrated !
it was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable .
the pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok .
the manager on duty came out to apologize , which i did appreciate .
i do n't think that casbah is my favorite anymore .
no thanks casbah !
we were willing to try again , so we went for dinner tonight .
i sent that back , and ordered the sea bass .
needless to say , i will never return to this restaurant .
- ambiance is nice , upscale , not too loud .
only complaint was that the cheeses were served too cold to fully appreciate them .
- mushroom pasta : again quite rich and salty .
that was n't to be .
i 'm so disappointed .
i would hate to lose this place !
wait time : we had a reservation , so we were seated right away .
not worth the price .
main dish : long island duck - too salty .
it is dark , so do n't expect to take any good photos .
i wish i could give it more stars , but really it was disappointing .
heavy and bland .
the service was also extremely slow .
_num_ minutes to get our bread and _num_ to get our appetizers .
wrong it was smaller portions at a higher price .
i never felt so ripped off .
$ _num_ for one meatball and three bites of pasta .
- this really was the standout .
so , i had been wanting to try this place for some time .
it was awful .
anyway , i 'm never going back here .
sub par at best , go to any of the other big burrito restaurants .
this is the worst fucking experience i 've ever had at a wine room .
i am standing waiting for our table _num_ minutes past our time .
i tried the gyro wrap which was also a big disappointment .
sooo wrong .
thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table .
the burger and `` spicy '' cajun soup were very mediocre .
i 'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over _num_ years .
every time i have ever gone , the service is awful .
i really , really wanted to like this restaurant .
i 'm not really a messy eater , but come on !
maybe part of the problem was expectations ?
learn from my mistake .
it 's never too loud or aggressive .
the food is inconsistent , but often good .
their food , service , and hours are inconsistent .
owners , please stick to your business hours .
it 's not like you 're open that late to begin with !
... my vote is to just stick with the hours you created .
yes , my food was tasty ( _num_ on a scale of 1-10 ) .
however , from the get go , our host was absolutely terrible .
he did not look us in the eye and was just overall awkward .
to be fair , our assigned server was very nice .
but of course , our food came and mine was cold .
it just was n't anything special .
needless to say , i will not be coming back to this place .
it tasted like nothing .
anything will taste better drenched in gravy .
on top of all this service was n't the greatest .
also they do n't really wash their cups .
it made me not want to drink my water even though i was thirsty .
good idea , but poorly executed food .
for a vegetarian place , there was nothing green on our plates .
worst tofu scramble ever .
days old , cold , hard , inedible .
sent it back and had no time to wait for another dish .
i 've found the service here to be pretty terrible .
sorry storm , you need to improve this .
if both of those conditions are n't true , then go anywhere else .
i 'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant .
yep , that description of their `` chorizo '' comes directly off their menu .
but do n't expect that feeling here .
two stars because i really like the drinks here .
this place is a train wreck .
the food is bland .
the service was pretty bad .
i think pittsburgh deserves better .
there are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this .
personally , i was n't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza .
if not , stay away .
do n't waste your money !
i was pretty disappointed with this place .
the fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless .
overall , i would n't go back .
i was a bit disappointed with the pizza i got .
i 'm not watching my weight -- i can handle it .
probably not ordering from here again .
pizza is pretty bland and there is nothing remarkable about it .
the pizza was n't bad , but it was n't great either .
given the relative quick delivery , it was on the cold side upon arrival .
also , i had ordered a fried pickle appetizer .
here 's the catch ... there was no sauce !
they literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us .
we tried bbq , garlic parmesan and spicy .
but this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was .
the outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little .
the wings were the most mediocre wings i have ever tasted .
final verdict : most mediocre wings in town !
could not understand what the foreign cashier was saying , made placing near impossible .
rude .
rude .
rude .
they do n't speak english and they do n't understand english .
and they are rude .
also the driver forgot to bring my drinks .
the vet met with us for a very short amount of time .
she seemed tired , and overworked .
all in all , this was a negative experience .
imho that 's ridiculous .
i will not recommended anyone to ever come here .
i was forced to locate another vet when i adopted a new kitten .
being treated extremely rudely by reception was the final straw .
thanks , but no thanks .
it is unfortunate .
however , i recently missed an appointment .
it is unfortunate that they have such a rude office manager .
this is not a place that a neighborhood should support .
ugh , my coworker spread open the spinach leaf .
the store seems to be a kind of a ripoff .
there was some improvement for awhile , but it has gotten worse .
they 're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas .
just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction .
normally , i have had the best experiences there .
my husband can not go back to construction junction today .
i am able to help move , i just could n't do it alone .
not anything like the pieces on the floor .
just thought you should know .
worst customer service i 've seen in a while .
+ _num_ star because they are finally installing air conditioning .
- the fees are unreasonable for the customer experience we get here .
worst climbing gym i have ever been to .
customer service was a joke .
first of all , the gym in pretty cheap .
even a small crack with a few problems set on it .
the staff was n't very helpful .
it 's poor form .
they are n't rated properly , just easy , medium , or hard .
i would n't go there again .
they told me that they charge _num_ dollars a hour .
the filet was decent but not $ _num_ worth of decent .
it was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories .
apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town .
i imagine less than _num_ % of expensive restaurants today are cash only .
the lamb burger was also overcooked .
very pricey food , cash only , average food .
these people could not care less .
ridiculous .
rude , unprofessional , and lazy .
the lady i spoke to was rude and unprofessional .
so when i got back to the office , i went online and checked .
nope , it said $ _num_ for a master stylist women 's haircut .
did n't she have my slip with the card number ?
it was n't the cut .
_num_ years i had this deal going on .
needless to say i have n't been back but would recommend in a jam .
sadly , the professionalism of the front desk never got better .
i was going to have so much done , too !
i 'll spend my money elsewhere !
i waited _num_ minutes and finally walked out .
receptionists were beyond awful .
i booked _num_ style appointments in advance for a wedding .
i waited _num_ minutes while being ignored by the receptionists .
i 'm not paying $ _num_ to get rushed service .
more unbelievable , i waited _num_ minutes to pay for the two services .
no wonder they need coupons for customers .
i did n't stay to find out how the haircut would have gone .
he also went on to give me the fastest haircut i 've ever had .
poor planning .
i will never return , to make any other purchases .
big waste of time and gas .
they do not have ice cream , only soft serve .
wow are their servers just lazy or dumb ?
this place is n't very good .
wo n't be going back .
i do n't understand the big hype over this place .
i 'm also not a fan of soft served ice cream .
a good family dollar this is not !
and they smoke around the food .
water glasses stayed empty for almost _num_ minutes !
ordered _num_ dishes , all pretty average .
i wo n't be back .
service is incredibly slow .
not worth it at all .
once seated , i practically had to beg for a wine list .
the cab was taking forever , so we called a different company .
as my boyfriend was talking with the cab company , a waitress walked by .
despite how great the food was , i wo n't be returning .
so disappointed .
i had a horrible experience .
at that time , i even had a terrible interaction with the owner .
this time , overpriced food and bad service .
this is a bad neighborhood .
i am not interested in ever going back !
not happy about the new staff .
the main reason for the low rating was the service .
that was not fair to her and definitely not fair to us .
sounds weird , but i never felt so rushed in a _num_ hour dinner .
i also did not like that we were seated at a high top table .
the biggest disappointment was the veal chop .
the disappointment was it was over-cooked .
not a spot of pink to be found .
just clear me out and get on with the next one .
crappy place .
i made reservation and still the table was not ready .
i am definitely not going to the place again .
everything else was yucky .
avoid !
i would not recommend working with dollar bank for a home mortgage .
my new goal is to deter anybody i know away from dollar bank .
i was totally underwhelmed .
this place does n't feel clean or inviting .
the decor was junkie and old and cluttered .
but sadly , i do n't see you at all in my future .
i got a fill and a fix because i broke a nail .
i was very uncomfortable the whole time i was there .
one of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me .
i will not be returning again .
they are n't very friendly there at all either .
not a bad place to get your nails done .
too over priced for mani and pedi .
terrible customer service !
but got the invoice three days before i got the estimate .
truly , you do n't need this kind of grief .
anybody that is not would be totally screwed by these people .
the quote was $ _num_ dollars .
one quote $ _num_ , another quote was $ _num_ .
needless to say , i will never be going here again .
my night was ruined thanks to this pizza hut .
i waited _num_ hour and _num_ minutes for my pizza to be delivered .
then when i got it , it was cold !
this is the worst chinese food i have had in a long time .
there were no other veggies or anything .
it was all mushy breading and very little chicken .
i ate _num_ bites and threw it away .
needless to say .
i wo n't be getting one again .
the pizza was bland , tasteless .
crust tasted like frozen pizza crust .
sausage was disgusting .
i do n't know what this sausage was other then disgusting .
why would they want to risk a customer not coming back .
these women are old middle aged miserable employees with no passion for their jobs .
i wo n't be back .
i was absolutely horrified !
if you have any alternative , though , i would avoid this place .
i am definitely not going back to complete the transaction .
do not go here for service on your bike .
maybe i just had a bad day .
this was the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
this is not even worthy of the name .
first bite the crust was almost raw , dense , and way too chewy .
there was no third bite .
the remaining slices got tossed in the garbage .
this was by far the worst `` pizza '' i 've ever had .
if zero was an option that is what i would rate them !
they are the worst company to ever deal with all they want is money !
zero if that was an opinion .
this place has the worst service i have ever seen .
he was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and pepsi .
it seems that this is a common experience at this restaurant .
recently it changed ownership and sadly the results are horrific .
not even a simple `` i 'm sorry . ''
needless to say we will never go there again .
and we could have been loyal customers for years to come .
also the ambiance of anthony 's is not the same .
very disappointed .
would n't recommend at all .
the quality was horrible .
the sauce was not a good flavor at all .
i had to wait _num_ hours just for a pick up for this crap .
the pizza bagels were soggy yet burned .
and the prices too high .
biggest waste of money !
i ordered a bacon pizza and breaded mushrooms .
disgusting is putting it lightly .
i threw the whole meal in the garbage .
it 's a shame , what happened ?
that is completely ridiculous .
it also does not help that they do not have beer prices listed .
one star for the ridiculous overcharge .
it was not good .
the hummus was okay , and our main plate seemed to be microwaved .
for dinner , not that great .
even though the groupon included menu items , they do n't have a kitchen .
they can keep the other groupon .
maybe they can use the money to buy some real food .
sales person treated me like i was a very inexperienced .
the owner is very pretentious and rude .
i am never going back to this place .
very disappointed that this is the only photo store in the city .
unfortunately , this is the only game in town .
makes me glad i live in new york city .
they gave me a nice receipt .
one week later i call , not ready .
the following week , they would call me back .
other than losing your stuff , they seem like nice guys .
service and products are lackluster .
overall , not a great choice .
in addition to being condescending , they hung up on me .
actually that is n't quite accurate .
neither one greeted me or asked me what i would have like to order .
she served the beer in a mason jar .
the food is n't fresh .
it was n't pan fried either .
my sides , german potato salad and braised red cabbage , were equally awful .
i did n't have more than a bite or two .
that 's total bullshit .
food was mediocre at best .
bland is the best description .
wo n't be back .
what was set in front me looked nothing like what i was used to .
sadly , i just did n't like it .
i thought it was actually not very appetizing at all .
what i was into was the german potato salad .
i was highly disappointed .
it was bad ... the you ca n't drink it kind of bad .
my husband has eaten there before and was sorely disappointed as well .
i really want to like this place .
it was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots .
reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat .
makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is .
the restaurant is located in a tired part of town .
for starters , the food is always served cold .
do n't believe me ?
yesterday they were undercooked , gritty , and gross .
in fact , all of the food is becoming gross .
you need a new chef , immediately .
if you want bland tasteless food , then stop here .
they need to get out of the _num_ 's with the decor .
beware of the ketchup .
then , they did n't even do anything to make it up to me .
not even the potato pancakes tasted good .
i 've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the holiday inn .
who knows how long that sour cream had been sitting out !
my water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it .
not a fan of this `` german '' place .
simply awful .
very low quality food for the price .
the only good part was the bacon , which was ok at best .
i have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant .
the service was terrible , took _num_ min to get a water .
we ordered the turkey reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes .
we also ordered max 's famous reuben , nothing famous about it .
worst .
everything ready in _num_ seconds because it sat under a heat lamp .
avoid at all cost .
potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them .
disappointed .
it should n't be this way .
if this is personalized service , i 'd rather stay at a motel .
even without grumpy old man , there 's nothing special about this place .
everything else was sub-par .
the dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful .
the hotel is in a bad neighborhood .
ugh .
about _num_ % more expensive .
why even keep this historical , old , dingy , dirty room ?
i was very specific when i made my reservations several months ago .
but , hey , i can always catch up on my sleep tomorrow night .
just bad service overall .
no one to help with bags morning or night .
even the day front desk person was short with us and rude .
i could n't wait to get out of there .
i would n't stay here again .
we never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying .
then refused to call m & p to talk to the manager .
i have terrible foot pain and can barely walk .
very disappointed that i can not be seen sooner .
do not believe he cares about his patients .
horrible food , horrible service .
the italian and mushroom steak hoagies were n't that great .
the steak was so chopped that it kept falling out of the bun .
the pizza was n't that good either .
$ _num_ for _num_ '' italian and $ _num_ for _num_ '' mushroom steak .
i will not get anything from there again .
it was like getting a shitty breakfast in a local sub dive bar .
ron 's pizza palace is cheap .
on multiple occasions in the past , i have ordered hoagies from ron 's .
the produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads .
i wo n't be ordering from ron 's again , despite the inexpensive menu .
with ron 's , you are better off considering fast food .
inconsistent again .
the last _num_ hoagies i 've gotten here is again only mediocre .
the bread is the best part , which is really sad .
was going to try the buffalo pizza .
no longer going to try .
and ... i was pretty underwhelmed .
fortunately , i 'd gotten that info when i ordered .
would i have had to call in to sort out their staff 's mistake ?
and the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired .
no such luck : it came on her sandwich just like everyone else .
i really do n't know how this place got any good reviews .
i got food poisoning and was so sick .
needless to say i refused to pay for them .
the 4th time my friend dragged me there , i had a salad .
it sounded like she described a bad breakfast joint ... '' oh that place ?
at this point , i am done .
its just sooo unprofessional and annoying .
so dissapointed and will never use them again .
this week is the 3rd week .
estimated delivery time _num_ minutes actually delivery time _num_ minutes .
pizza hut , a pizza of last resort .
estimated delivery time from an online order : _num_ min .
do n't bother with delivery here .
this is the worst location .
two hours and i 'm still waiting on a slow sunday night .
really bad service !
food is ok but horrible delivery service .
they called on the wrong number despite we have given the right one .
horrible horrible service .
small , overcrowded , unfriendly staff .
the food is okay - typical italian fair that could be better seasoned .
the shrimp and pasta , however , were cooked well .
the mozzarella was unremarkable , deep friend mozzarella in breading .
of course it was good , it is fried cheese !
but it was nothing special .
prices were inflated for a limited valentines day menu .
never again , they are off my list .
if i could give this restaurant a zero , i would .
do not go to this restaurant !
their food was mediocre at best .
i will not be going back .
went for the first and last time tonight .
$ _num_ corkage fee for _num_ bottle of wine .
the restaurant is so small and they have a problem with managing customers .
the food was less than average .
we ordered an app and unfortunately this is where our problems began .
they brought mussels instead of our mozzarella sticks .
but this was quickly corrected .
but unfortunately they had already sold out of the special .
i give them a _num_ for presentation .
so i guess i did a good job at picking out the wine .
but did nothing to make up for it .
soups could have been a bit more full in the cups .
the worst thing about this place is also sam .
the only redeeming quality is the young girl who works here .
does not honor national sub day offer .
too late to back out .
this giant eagle maybe the worst supermarket i 've ever been to .
worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
to make it worse , they are supposed to open at _num_ .
one thing i like about the store is the proximity to my house .
it 's close to my neighborhood , hence the _num_ star .
but seriously , it 's like walmart stuff at whole food 's price .
but overall the store is way too pricy - for no good reason !
when i want to cook pretentious gourmet food , they have every ingredient ready .
my recommendation was to burn this place to the ground .
the produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good .
the store never looks very clean .
however , the quality of the produce from my experience is pretty poor .
the lines are always long and take forever to get through .
furthermore , the stuff in the bakery and goodies are below par .
i 'd recommend stopping in another giant eagle if you can .
i 've had a lot of bad experiences at this store .
i talked to him for _num_ minutes and he was polite and friendly .
such a shame about this place .
the store itself seemed really outdated and stinky .
waste of time .
i dont even bother coming here anymore .
all bad news .
went to this store today and it was worse than usual .
i 'm too scared to shop there after dark .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
i wish the north side had another option but we do n't .
giant eagle should be ashamed of this establishment .
if i was _num_ i would have beat his ass over that .
like who goes from _num_ 's to _num_ 's in _num_ days ?
horrible customer service !
owner takes no responsibility for ruining clothing .
they had a dj so there was a cover of $ _num_ - boo !
for those that know me , i 'm not the gambling kind .
it was n't overly crowded which made it easy to get drinks .
saturdays there is a cover for the dj which was $ _num_ .
however some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross .
my jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke .
for some reason two drinks came out to $ _num_ .
however , i ca n't let this slide : your claw machine is bullshit .
that 's a lot of beer for less than _num_ dollars .
the worst customer service ever !
i normally do n't do this but i 'm so disappointed .
if you care about your natural nails , stay away from this place .
i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i 'm glad i do n't eat at this restaurant very often .
i really was n't thrilled with our meal here .
the breading was much too heavy and you could barely taste the vegetable .
the pasta was cooked well and the sauce was fine though .
i hope the owner or general manager reads this .
service is mediocre and slow .
waitress was ok in attitude .
that 's _num_ minutes to be next .
manager embarrassed himself .
how hard is it to do chicken marsala with mushrooms , seriously ?
the penne ala vodka was sauteed canned tomatoes and no flavor .
the service is terrible .
i do n't know if they hate working there or hate serving people .
why be in the service business if you have a bad attitude ?
i have been here a couple of times and it does n't change .
i 've never had a staring contest with a hostess before .
it 's bizarre .
so if you 're a horse you wo n't go thirsty .
this was ridiculous to us so we left !
ugh , i hate this place .
people from work drag me here to lunch more often than i would like .
the service is snotty and slow .
the food is forgettable and the menu sparse .
i tried the seared ahi tuna .
but do n't go for the menu .
otherwise , food and prices are not worth a stop .
it is n't a bad experience .
maybe it 's just the built in crowd .
crab fries , naturally .
was n't the best either .
service , small selection and mediocre food .
ca n't comment on any other time but this really hectic one .
not a degree above room temp .
limited menu .
my reuben tasted like eating a salt stick .
service was fast , but the salad and cup of soup were disappointing .
the chopped salad had weird cheap ingredients like celery and carrot .
but let me tell you , i was highly disappointed .
first of all , our service was awful .
but now i 'm weary of the restaurant all together .
i was meeting up with _num_ other people there .
not even to just get drinks or an appetizer ordered .
i ordered a hamburger with fries for $ _num_ .
very disappointed .
it took over _num_ minutes to get the order .
the meat was very dry and falling apart but not over cooked .
awful place , to bad i was looking forward .
we only wish we would have ordered food and then left .
try as he could , he could not do it all .
a party of _num_ , we agreed to sit _num_ and _num_ .
i was wrong .
no chicken .
not even one piece .
no potatoes or any other filling except a few peas .
extremely disappointing .
service was slow for soup and a salad .
mediocre at best .
went to easter brunch , was served some coffee from a can .
i do n't understand how this place is even in business .
if this establishment were to be in any other city they would be closed .
this place is a fusion of olive garden and red lobster .
was n't very busy which was a plus .
did n't matter that our food was n't correct and our drinks were empty .
bathrooms were dirty and ladies room had no toilet paper or soap .
service is terrible and wo n't return .
i was really excited to hear that they had smoked salmon .
however , when we got there the buffet was well picked over .
i was mostly wrong .
the food was not great and not worth the price at all .
it came out of the kitchen with noodles instead of the potatoes .
but that should be explained by the waitstaff when someone orders the meal !
we also waited over _num_ minutes before someone even took our order .
going downhill ... ... man , what happened to this place ?
unfortunately our waiter was not up to par .
it is difficult to get under my skin .
house salads for the wife and i which were pretty standard .
we also got a chicken ranch flat bread and this left us disappointed .
that is $ _num_ month from august to march .
they probably knew we would n't have the money for a lawyer .
we spent $ _num_ on admission & parking for _num_ adults and _num_ kids .
we will not be back .
we feel like our money was wasted .
the only downfall was their delivery time .
good food , but rude service on the phone and in person .
i tried pickles tonight for the first time .
i called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told _num_ minutes .
it was another _num_ before i got my food .
in a bad frame of mind , i tried my food .
i did n't have an issue with the place or the other patrons .
from the food to the prices , you could n't find better .
i 'm thinking we 've struck out .
first of all , ordering was strange .
wow ... we 're we disappointed .
the crust was super doughy and the cheese was pretty gross .
do n't do it !
the bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all .
they do n't take debit or credit cards .
never open when you need it , unreliable availability with his products .
you disappointed me .
i have been a steelers fan as long as i can remember .
so not cool steelers !
my friend lives near here so i came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving .
it was bad .
it made me kind of sad .
o my pittsburgh pirates .
i warn you dear pirates -- it wo n't be pretty .
another losing season .
but was a winning season too much to ask for ?
you also used pay phones because you did n't have a cell phone .
i 'm no fair weather fan , but 20+ years of losing is enough .
what a disappointment .
they topped off my coolant for free and changed my oil .
he asked me if i had $ _num_ cash on me .
i ai n't going back where they treat customers like that .
which is pretty sad .
was so excited to get your pizza today .
very disappointed in the quality of what i got .
how sad is this so not happy .
used to be the best i 've ever had .
wise guys is your typical off beat pizza shop .
there are no frills , there are no items i would particularly recommend .
there are other better pizza places in the area .
the hostess was incredibly rude directly off of the bat .
it was just as lousy as the lunch .
unfortunately , the second visit was n't any better .
the place smells of smoke .
gross .
walking on it with shoes on disgusted me .
the walls have wall paper torn off throughout the place .
do n't get the salmon or tuna steak .
both tasted very fishy to me .
mashed potatoes are not made from real potatoes .
do n't get them unless you are looking to eat boxed potatoes .
i get it , you wan na have a mom and pop shop .
apparently with this kind of reception , no one wants to pay full price .
mom and i both ordered the fish sandwich with mac n cheese .
overall , it was a larger than average portion for a good fish sandwich .
the place is dated and could use updating .
her first bite she made a sour face .
my son and i then tasted it ... understood the face after that .
the pasta was overcooked and the shrimp just sort of were there .
the breaded shrimp tasted weird too .
needless to say , none of us finished our food .
for a $ _num_ dollar meal , it was n't worth $ _num_ .
no , just no .
they told a driver must have taken by accident .
terrible .
ordered twice in the last _num_ days and both times it was terrible .
both were crappy , at best .
staff was really rude both times .
he just said `` sorry man '' and did n't offer any solutions .
it would 've taken very little effort to fix it for us .
too much cheese on their pizzas , and the customer service is incredibly poor .
it 's a shame .
all it would have take n was a new pizza and wings .
$ _num_ a week plus gone from them .
she claimed they did n't deliver to his address which was _num_ mile away .
remember , the call was on speaker so i overheard both sides .
my friend was not rude , not disrespectful , just looking to order food .
hard to contact .
walked off the job and all the work completed was not done properly .
also , alcohol in the air here too .
very disappointed .
original post written september _num_ - i do n't recommend this company .
poor quality work .
i would never use them again .
very disappointed .
delivery was late , our gyros were cold and fries were soggy .
this was probably the worst gyro i have ever had .
ok atmosphere drinks are overpriced for the area .
it was so dirty i could barley contain myself .
the staff completely ignored it .
this is a gathering place for human garbage anymore .
check my purse , yes , but leave my purse with complete strangers ?
it just left a bad taste in my mouth .
years and years of spilled food / blood from the meat department and etc .
had a friend who went here .
the owner is the one who took my appointment .
they are a hot mess .
i came in tonight ready to buy a bike .
i was really disappointed .
the only people getting help in there tonight were two other guys .
what a terrible experience .
i 'm glad i took my money elsewhere .
disgusting & totally unsanitary imo .
i 'd go back for bottled beer , that 's about it .
i hate writing a less than stellar review of a business .
this is where i get a serious case of the sad .
the bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence .
it happens !
that 's sort of disappointing but still fine .
the owner refuses to take care of black people .
not sure what people see here but it 's a never again .
it was busy but at times could n't find her .
i had an ugly haircut .
for $ _num_ with the owner .
this time around i am extremely upset .
karen left the color on my hair way too long .
the worst of it is the damage caused by being over processed .
i would like to say that i am only disappointed by what 's happened .
i very much regret ever trying this salon .
when i arrived , i was seated quickly and greeted by a stylist .
what a complete waste of time .
they told me it was it was because i was booking with the owner .
i 've had appointments with salon owners and never had to leave payment info .
i was not a fan and probably wo n't be back .
this was my second visit and alas , my last .
as for my ca rolls , the avocado was all brown !
avocado is like banana .
not wiped down in a long while or perhaps ever .
needless to say , we skipped dessert .
our first visit deserved a _num_ but this visit was a _num_ .
i was not impressed with the sushi either .
i would not recommend this place .
always seem to be people going in and out .
the shrimp lo mein was ok but the shrimp was overcooked .
the moo shu pork was forgettable .
yeah , do n't order from here , unless it 's for dumplings .
everything else we had sucked .
shrimp and scallop with garlic was bland as hell .
i only took _num_ bite and did n't want anymore .
the wonton soup i have to say though was very good .
the chicken lo mein and fried rice were okay .
nothing special .
the price was fair and the delivery driver was nice .
i probably wo n't order here again though .
horrible food .
it 's hard to get a good chinese restaurant around pittsburgh .
person on the taking orders was rude when i called back with a problem .
this place has ok food and bad customer service .
terrible .
no .
she refused .
a completely clueless one , that 's what kind .
she simply said `` ok '' and walked out of the room .
meaning , i never saw her full face .
or maybe i 'm wrong .
the answer , so bad !
it 's all cheap but that 's not reason to be terrible .
only once was it under par .
how about horrible customer service ?
long time customer and disappointed to say will not buy from them again .
absolutely horrible way to treat a customer when they were the ones in error .
apparently they feel that frozen cakes are acceptable for events .
thanks for the disappointment to me and my son !
this place is the worst motel i have ever stayed .
this was the worst hotel that i ever stayed in .
i was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed .
horrible place !
pretty rough , but not completely unbearable .
the location is n't ideal ; on the side of a busy highway .
the overall condition of the hotel was n't promising on first entrance .
the room continued to be unimpressive .
- no visible signs of bed bugs .
probably not .
it 's dirty and weird .
the free breakfast is as bad as it gets .
( old cereal and bread . )
i fall into the later category : i did n't like it at all .
the salad was ... nothing short of horrific .
eventually , i found bland tomatoes and shredded iceberg lettuce hidden far below .
i do n't get this place .
sorry , but our pizza was cold .
and the garlic wings did n't taste like garlic .
some customers may like it , me , not so much .
they put oil on the sandwich , but no other dressing .
i expected a nice tangy flavor to compliment the meat but was disappointed .
my date ordered a hot sausage hoagie .
the bread got soggy and the darn thing fell apart .
it looked more like tomato soup with sausage than a sandwich .
the dining room is also a bit cramped .
hungry patrons also are constantly getting up to visit the soda fountain .
this was just bad pizza .
for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .
also the mushrooms were out of a can .
do not waste money here .
i guess a lot of people like it , and more power too them .
but i do n't get it .
way too much cheese .
the pizza crust tasted like pizza hut .
i did n't even know you could get canned green bell peppers .
if answer is yes , then maybe this place is for you .
it is definitely not for me .
this `` pizza '' was the worst food i have ever eaten .
i do n't get it .
cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza ?
why does pittsburgh have to be so weird ?
no professionalism .
_num_ cents per slice for every topping ?
not a medium .
no way .
a ton of cold shredded cheese thrown on top of pizza ?
no no no .
no beer either .
whoever recently took over , should be ashamed .
worse than store freezer pizza .
terrible .
, i would have never known .
had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .
i would n't take somewhere here as a pittsburgh destination though .
did n't live up to my expectations at all .
waste of time and money .
it does n't work .
man was this place packed !
however it just does not work for me .
rude .
if i could rate it zero stars i would .
i ca n't understand how this place stays in business .
i disliked the cold cheese and cold pepperoni on so so crust .
not comparable to the other top ten pizza joints in pittsburgh .
i really wanted to like this place but alas it just was n't happening .
they put way too much cheese on everything .
i know , you say , how can one possibly have too much cheese .
totally my own fault , but still , watch out .
went for lunch for hoagie , fries and _num_ cuts .
would n't recommend .
he employees walk by dirty tables then people sit at them .
my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .
after finishing mine , we inquired about our take out .
what they said was `` i do n't know what you 're talking about .
terrible experience !
stay away unless you 're just buying tires !
very disappointed with this dry cleaner .
i do n't normally get my beer from there .
small dark not very opening or friendly place .
will not be returning .
the only good thing was free parking out back .
had n't even read the reviews beforehand .
it was karaoke tonight , not my fav but whatever .
mediocre and poorly made !
i would give this eat n park location zero stars if i could .
i did not receive water or any service for _num_ minutes .
do n't waste your time .
it 's fairly disgusting ( sticky tables , trash everywhere ) .
dairy queen only serves two flavors of ice cream so this is fairly unacceptable .
we tried to explain this and the clerk said nope , not allowed .
if i could give this place less than one star i would .
but the customer service is by far the worst i have ever experienced .
i would never give these people my money again .
this is by far not true in this store .
the service is rather incompetent .
it would have been nice to know whom .
ca n't understand the big secret about that one .
it is still in plastic and there are no burn marks .
i was grateful for justin since he was the most helpful to me .
so consider my advice if you decide to purchase here .
this was done _num_ years ago .
i ca n't believe this place has n't been reviewed .
nothing more , and nothing less .
my girlfriend and i came to have some dinner around _num_ pm .
sadly , this was the last time that she ever came to our table .
we sat and waited for more than _num_ minutes .
will i come back to your restaurant , i 'm not sure .
it went to voice mail , so i left a message .
support local businesses , but make sure they are deserving of your money !
atmosphere is awesome ... food is terrible .
no flavor , soggy french fries , over sauces wings .
_num_ minutes later my date had finished his meal and my fries were gone .
my breakfast burrito tasted like nothing and a our food was cold .
the only good thing about the experience was the warm donuts .
poor service , crappy food .
overall not the way a restaurant should be run .
i would give this place half a star if i could .
the service was the most appalling i have ever experienced .
do not order steak or prime rib here .
the prime rib , ordered rare , was medium , dry and extremely salty .
the rib eye was thinly cut , salty and dry .
the bill was $ _num_ so it is pricey .
i was very disappointed and would not order anything but wings here .
the fourth got his about _num_ minutes later and his food was terrible .
cold .
stale .
then , she sat _num_ small parties there .
bad idea .
this place is a bad idea all around .
lots of tv 's and ok atmosphere so i will squeeze out _num_ stars .
very disappointed in this place .
we are never going back .
this place is sad .
but all of the pretzel bun sandwiches are n't that great .
fishy smell .
not fresh at all .
also did n't seem very nice .
very annoyed and ignorant !
this place is empty ... .
and _num_ bbq dishes .
not hot at all ... .
server kim was awesome .
but kitchen has a lot of problems .
the variety of sauces is what gets me to come back .
i 'm sure it would have been great !
the gravy ( breakfast gravy ) was warm , however everything underneath was cold .
i am not exaggerating in the least .
anything dealing with food is a train wreck .
i may come to have drinks , but never to eat .
you 've been warned !
if i could less than a star i would .
service was extremely slow to begin with .
go figure cooked , but cold .
they ended up making a new one and the wait was over _num_ minutes .
one minute later all of our food was delivered cold .
it 's also really expensive .
it 's not worth the money .
the place had a great location but otherwise it 's a waste .
it was a place where everybody knew my name .
i would always suggest it when friends asked me where to go .
i can not speak for others .
all that money spent elsewhere because of one power trip .
will never go back !
asked to refill my coffee and got a cold one .
unbelievable .
average bar food , slow service , a nice selection of incredibly overpriced beers .
go to the original pancake house about _num_ minutes away for a better breakfast .
pancakes were not very good .
average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive .
very small and uncomfortable .
dont fall for it .
especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm .
such a waste of time .
i think we waited about _num_ mins , which was n't bad .
our waitress had n't stopped by our table in a long time .
no hint of a smile on her face .
are we really hungry or really impatient ?
i dunno .
maybe the waitress was having a bad day .
everybody told me i had to try and their pancakes .
well , the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes .
i do not get the hype behind this place .
it was just average and did n't really have any taste .
it came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package .
the worst part of this last visit was the service .
after standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check .
i wo n't be back .
i stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter .
i did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left .
i am not sure if i will go back which is really a shame .
i ate less than half of the meal and left .
i would n't go back .
urban spoon rated _num_ % favorite .
this pizza is not good .
the hype surrounding this place will probably lead to your great disappointment .
i would n't order a pizza from them again .
now it 's just crap .
not a dime every again .
almost three days later , i had n't heard back from them .
my biggest issue was the attitude i received when i called .
so he ca n't bother with mine .
i would n't recommend this mechanic to anyone .
having curly hair , i 've had my fair share of terrible haircuts .
the one i had at this salon was among the worst .
the owner clearly has no idea how to cut curly hair .
it all could have been so easily avoided .
it does n't feel fair .
not nice !
i am not impressed .
mediocre food service and atmosphere .
bland reheated samosas .
barely reheated naan .
obviously that feeling is long gone .
clearly she had a nasty cold and should 've stayed home that day !
i 'm not sure what was worse food or service .
oily , greasy and bad taste .
shockingly bad .
the young waiter was ok but clearly scared of the woman .
the old woman was not nice .
that said ... for _num_ people , my lunch tab came to $ _num_ .
for an appetizer , _num_ entrees , and naan .
no drinks .
so , i will never be back .
which is sad , really .
i wish i could give them _num_ stars ... total waste of money .
food was so bad that i threw it in the trash .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
food was terrible .
all tasted like old food .
hope no one falls sick after eating food here .
also the food was bland and pretty much flavorless , very disappointing .
needless to say , we will never return !
severely disappointed .
i ordered chicken curry .
this place is pretty bad .
the food is n't fresh .
terrible place to eat and not very clean at all .
_num_ $ for a plain roast beef forget that !
i was desperately hungry late one night with no other options .
my guess is that it was that suspect sauce you put on that sandwich .
i ordered two chicken finger kids meals and two adult meals .
had to pull forward and wait another ten minutes for food .
when i got home they did n't give me my kids meals .
the place is crowded and cramped too , but not unpleasant .
sadly really went downhill .
the bloody mary was pretty awesome for what i assume is a pre-made mix .
i also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell !
iceberg lettuce , croutons , cucumbers , and dry swordfish .
lame .
she also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average .
hostess was very awkward when seating us .
i just feel like i 've had much better pizza elsewhere around town .
one of the worst steak sandwiches i 've ever eaten .
everything is basic with a large price tag .
rude , unfriendly , just a miserable male server .
there were _num_ of us .
it was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese .
unfortunately , the hair did not stop there .
luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight .
however , the reaction that we received was unacceptable .
very disappointed in our delivery order this evening .
the wedding soup was less than fair .
thee buffalo chicken sandwich had no lettuce or tomato on it .
the reuben and fries were soggy and greasy .
it was a disgrace .
disappointed .
worst waitress ever .
could n't remember anything .
husband ordered penne chicken vodka sauce .
it was runny and bland .
would not go back .
the same plain pizza we order never seems to taste the same .
the fries were ways very soggy and cold .
i want so badly to like this place !
but the last three times the staff has been awful .
horrible drink ( old fashioned ) ?
spaghetti -- huge amount , no taste ?
noise level -- painful ?
i 've been wanting to stop in here for the longest time .
pizza , sandwiches , beer , what could go wrong ?
well , it was n't horrible but it also did n't blow me away .
all in all , very disappointing in our book .
delivery guy was shady too .
i did n't bother to ask if anything was organic .
i do n't like this place at all .
i do n't recommend at all .
no apology or explanation , just a bad attitude .
however once opened not so much .
i wish there were negative stars i could put for this place .
i have never been treated that way with any owner of a business .
unbelievable .
as it is right now , do not patronize this business .
there was absolutely no excuse for his attitude .
got a bang trim , a low # _num_ cut , and a wash .
i showed the lady the picture of my desired bang .
she went ahead started to cut my bang after looking at it .
are you kidding me ?
and i replied , `` no , i 'm sorry .
it 's not what i was looking for , but thank you '' .
this is the worst company as far as billing & customer service are concerned .
when you try to cancel it takes forever and they are rude !
* no shopping carts .
salad will come first , then a couple of dogs , then fries .
now , their service : really lackluster .
the waitstaff all seems to think highly of themselves .
hardly saw any of that today .
fries are nothing special .
the worst part , though , is the service .
you practically have to beg the waitresses to pay any attention to you .
and i do n't even mean refilling your drink .
however , check the price of a beer before you buy it .
but not $ _num_ for _num_ standard size dog good .
not a good value in my book .
probably wo n't be back .
shame on me .
check out the better business bureau ( bbb ) .
are you kidding me ?
we were leaving to go _num_ miles away the next day for the wedding .
now , after picking up my dress we realized they ordered the wrong size !
the size that i ordered required zero alterations .
after calling every day for a week i was furious .
he barely let me talk and continuously spoke over me .
the downside : the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done .
awful customer service !
she was sooooo rude .
a voice from downstairs says `` i 'm down here . ''
she then starts up the stairs and says `` no go upstairs . ''
and then she said `` no , what kind of dress . ''
she took me into the room of dresses and said to look around .
they ca n't even give you the courtesy of trying on their dresses .
so i had high hopes that my _num_ ( ! )
but getting to that point was one disaster after another .
then , in june , my maid of honor calls me .
but it was not the dress she ordered .
not even close .
fast forward to july ( _num_ weeks before the wedding ) .
she said there was no time to order another dress .
no time to get additional fabric .
in the end , that bridesmaid got a partial refund for the dress .
this experience was not worth the beautiful dresses .
save yourself the headache and stay away from this establishment .
worst dry cleaners ever .
also , the staff was fairly rude and all had chips on their shoulders .
the owner ( larger woman ) is rude and dismissive of my questions .
i wo n't be coming here again .
turned out to be way more hassle than it was worth .
i left them as i was not in a rush .
this was during business hours that i was told to wait outside .
these people are totally incompetent .
i would n't trust them with a pair of socks .
do not use these people for your dry cleaning needs !
unfortunately zero stars is not an option .
there 's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place .
shame on you cathy !
let me start off by saying , i hate the dentist .
it is my worst fear .
and for $ _num_ that 's disappointing .
what i got was dry and totally tasteless .
the whole burger just tasted like nothing .
it was accompanied by some typical frozen steak fries .
again no salt or seasoning .
rather disappointed .
i met my friend jean here , she is a once a week customer .
i chose a veggie wrap , sans cheese with a side of apple sauce .
she complained the tea was weak , i never noticed .
so why my low score ?
waited _num_ minutes for drinks , _num_ minutes for good .
food was average , service very bad .
never going back .
finally order and pull around , i wait another five minutes .
all i can really say is that she was a real ball of sunshine .
the drive through service here leaves something to be desired .
not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy .
the service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse .
worst service .
slow .
bad !
real bad .
i want to know what to expect , you know ?
they do n't use their space well .
it just looked really sparse .
this is a depressing coffee shop .
there 's no smoking inside , of course , but it always happened .
i guess that is really the only thing this place has going for it .
tables are often dirty .
dirty tables , i agree with the other reviews here .
no additional fans , nothing .
i asked for my money back .
you know what was the worst thing , though ?
then the ultimate insult : _num_ kids came in selling candy bars .
well , that coffee i spent $ _num_ on ?
that is the last money i will spend in that place .
disgusting .
does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge ?
i would beg the owners to put any effort into this place .
i asked for a pen , not a kidney .
yeah , i 'm not coming here anymore .
_num_ ) they use canned whipped cream .
_num_ ) my hot chocolate was just gross .
is it possible to give zero stars ?
this place has gone downhill tremendously .
its _num_ and they still do n't take credit and or debit cards .
but they use the cheapest meats they can find and you can taste it .
pizza was fine but nothing special .
the salad i ordered was wrong , though .
and beware of the prices : what 's on the website is wrong .
this store is so gross that i was almost sick !
i will never step foot in this place again .
i really do n't get giant eagle .
he told me i had about _num_ minutes to get it .
i informed him i had about _num_ minutes .
i left my intended purchases and walked out without buying .
no reply .
six days and it cost _num_ dollars .
just terrible .
just go elsewhere .
not even remotely convenient .
one of the worst wendy 's i 've ever experienced .
did n't get all of the items i ordered and paid for !
we also did n't get straws , or utensils for our food .
nothing special , it is kmart after all .
it is dirty and the employees are lazy and exceptionally slow .
needless to say , i will not go here again .
are employees required to be grumpy here ?
they all look like they hate their job .
first off , i like family restaurants and avoid chains when possible .
the managers do n't care .
then she gave it to us before thinking to ask if we wanted another .
just go anywhere else , it ca n't be worse !
nothing special .
worst applebee 's experience i 've had .
we were seated and then waited _num_ minutes to even be greeted .
and then it was only because we flagged someone down .
no apologies when we were finally taken care of .
should have listened to my gut on this one .
but i did n't have a problem with that .
what i have a problem with is all the nasty flies in the building .
and while you 're eating too ... it 's so disgusting .
as far as the menu , i was n't impressed .
but i ended up with the chicken broccoli alfredo , nothing to rave about .
another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff !
still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care .
i said no thanks .
takeout is a mess at this location .
very awkward location and atmosphere .
i keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed .
it 's just rolls off the tongue , does n't it ?
i hate complaining like this .
but sometimes , you just have to , ya know ?
when she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay .
from start to finish , the entire evening was a terrible experience .
there are better hibachi options in the area .
the service can be okay or awful .
but she said no , we absolutely could not order ice cream separately .
very disappointing .
we love japanese steak houses and this was our least favorite meal in pittsburgh .
the salad dressing was tasteless , the jumbo shrimp was under cooked and chewy .
it tasted more steamed than hot grilled .
the shrimp sauce was very thick and not that flavorful .
this is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant i have eaten at .
not only was the food bad but the service was terrible .
this is the worst hibachi i have ever had .
not good .
my boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle .
i replied `` no , you never served me any . ''
by the time they were cooked , everyone was finished eating .
that does n't say too much for the rest of them .
i do n't know how people keep coming here .
there is way better hibachi in pittsburgh , for a lot less money .
benihana is not worth your time or money .
by now its nearly _num_ o'clock .
by this point we 've been waiting for _num_ minutes .
this is totally unacceptable .
the horrible location ?
the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?
as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .
looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .
the horrible location ?
the hostess that had little to nothing to say prior or during our seating ?
as we get our 2nd batch of sushi our soup was still not ready .
looks and taste both scored a _num_ out of _num_ .
fist we wait _num_ mins or so to be seated .
the restaurant was n't even half full .
our hibachi chef was absolutely horrible !
he barely spoke and did n't put on any kind of show at all !
our _num_ year old was so bored that she wanted to leave .
none of us even like onions .
the manager did n't seem to care at all about our situation .
we feel completely cheated .
since the changes its just awful .
very sad .
sometimes i ate there _num_ or _num_ times a month .
w h at a shame .
i just hate to see it .
extremely disappointed , food was absolutely awful .
our vegetables were so soft , they all tasted the same , mushy .
our chicken was flavorless and rubbery .
this will be our last trip here as there are now much better options .
it 's too bad a once gold standard restaurant is not any longer .
went for a friend 's birthday and had the worst experience ever .
no explanation , no apology , nothing .
the presentation of the food was awful .
compared to other restaurants this is my least favorite .
this is the worst hibachi restaurant in pittsburgh .
the food was cold and everything was flavorless .
the salad and steak sauce tasted like cleaner .
the chicken was also extremely dry .
this is place is no longer what it used to be .
also , they did n't have much of a sushi menu at all .
it was really disappointing .
the place was completely empty .
i was mortified , my boyfriend was mortified , the waitress looked mortified .
my brother was uncomfortable and embarrassed and just kept staring down .
he should n't have been put in that position .
shame on you benihana .
dirty place and horrible service .
loud is an understatement .
it took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda .
what we got at long last was so disappointing .
there is much better mexican food and drink in the 'burgh .
you have no idea how badly i want to like this place .
i just have n't been impressed by anything i 've ordered there .
even the chips and salsa are n't terribly good .
even the guacamole was too hot .
it was very noisy and i do not recommend for kids .
the chicken fajita was over cooked , dry , and charred .
everything was overpriced ; drinks , entrees , and dessert .
the waiter was horrible and barely checked on us .
the food was also not too good .
it was very bland and did n't have a lot of taste to it .
i will not be coming back .
the food is n't terrible , but not impressive .
there was nothing memorable about the taste of it whatsoever .
been here a few times now , food is mediocre at best .
it 's hit or miss with this place , but mostly a miss .
the food was okay , but worst service ever .
i was really hoping that this place would have good food .
i ordered _num_ ground beef tacos with black beans and rice .
the tacos were decent but the rice and beans were horrible .
both were very dry and lacked flavor .
horrible service .
it was loud , but expected that on a friday night .
bartender came back quickly with what looked like watered down lemonade .
worst margarita i have ever been served !
described as being served with butternut squash , brussel sprouts and cauliflower .
did n't even get time under the warmer .
glad i tried this place but wo n't rush back .
sorry , bummer .
service was mediocre but the food was poor .
burnt chicken in the burrito .
there was no mole sauce as described in the dish .
this was explained to us before we ordered .
this restaurant has really gone downhill over the last few years .
have n't been here in a long time because the service and food suck !
that was one of the worst burritos i have ever , ever had .
never again mad mex south hills !
waited _num_ minutes for drink , waitress got my order wrong .
not worth the trip .
i am a ten minute drive from this location .
i attended the sushi class on monday night .
for $ _num_ per person , i was beyond disappointed .
can you give a company zero stars ?
this place makes you feel unwelcome and dumb .
just a poorly laid out store which is showing it 's age .
not laid out well .
rude cashiers .
self check out usually broken .
horrible experience more than once .
store is too small and always crowded .
managers and workers are rude and condescending .
actually just had an awful experience with a manager named chris .
i have witnessed him being rude and condescending to other customers too .
had a beer and an appetizer , so-so .
huge line at mad mex on friday night , none here .
i doubt we will go back , too many other choices .
was n't the best experience .
the food was ok but nothing to great .
not up to it 's previous brunch standards .
ugh .
if you 're not getting that , do n't bother .
at eat n ' park , free cookies are a staple .
needless to say we left , and we will not be going back .
i wish i could give this no stars !
this place was not packed .
while waiting , i used the ladies restroom .
does n't anyone come and check this ?
came back and dropped them off and left again .
your menu is n't that big !
however , there was no way i was sending it back .
i did n't even eat all of it .
i gave half of it to my husband to eat .
the fries are very salty .
rude !
either way , i am not going back to find out .
high prices , horrible service !
i only went here because i had a groupon .
huge mistake .
off to sams ... .
model cleaners failed to deliver _num_ shirts and _num_ suits in june .
after a few phone calls later , no shirts , no suits .
so , i am assuming they were delivered by a neighbor .
i then took inventory of my suits and found that _num_ suits are missing !
i will be doing business elsewhere .
so incompetent i did not even get a chance to rate the actual service .
we went for a second opinion elsewhere and i 'm glad we did .
guy on the front desk has the attitude problem .
the people all look like they hate their jobs and treat the customers accordingly .
i threw my mean in the garbage .
this wendy 's is terrible .
there 's nothing fast about this fast food .
at first i thought maybe it was a fluke .
- and they left me hanging .
but based on other reviews , even this is n't always the case .
received bad service today .
however , lots of seats since the place was empty .
we left einstein 's because it was crowded .
they missed an opportunity to impress a new customer .
repeated my order _num_ times and it still got screwed up .
my dad would always take me to this place when i was little .
i usually do not like posting negative reviews .
poor service , menu options not available , dirty utensils .
instead of the amazing tomato bread i got plain rye .
if your seeking genuine medical attention i would strongly suggest another facility .
no lab coat , no name tag , no introduction , no nothing .
i asked if he is a doctor and she replied , `` no .
their service is terrible .
i was ; however , charged for the basket .
do n't order from this shop if you want a timely delivery .
the food was cooked well , but lackluster .
have mixed vincent 's .
just goes to show , it depends on what you order .
overpriced , very slow service , food was decent .
food is mediocre service is lousy .
i was disappointed with the seafood salad .
of shrimp and _num_ scallops with very little salad greens for alot of money .
service was good but probably the worse pizza i 've ever had .
we could n't eat it .
waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks .
my hoagie was dry with min meat .
probably wont go back .
pizza was good but really expensive .
i also got a _num_ pack that cost _num_ dollars .
the same _num_ pack cost _num_ back in my hometown .
i dont eat meat so i ate the spinach ravioli and it was ok .
breadsticks and meatball sub for my mother .
the breadsticks were sitting a in pool of oil .
the meatballs sub , my mother said was cold and undercooked .
it was n't fresh at all .
we finally got our money back , we did n't even eat the food .
and the service just was disappointing , all for take out .
when i was little there was always enough donuts for everyone !
they know they sell out before _num_ and they only open at _num_ !
everyone hates it ... and unfortunately i drive it frequently .
as mentioned by others , this road is not in the best shape .
and this is n't even the halfway point to philly .
and there are n't as many rest stops .
fyi - prices are scheduled to go up jan _num_ _num_ .
surprisingly what remains seems to be doing good business .
kmart is doing okay as is the giant eagle .
that 's not an eatery either .
i soon left and went over to olive garden for lunch .
dead malls are sad , for some reason .
walking through this mall just creepy though .
truly the worst mall in america .
going here is like being in a time machine though .
man , the rent has to be so cheap !
honestly i do n't consider this place a mall .
stay away , there 's nothing here to see .
this mall is dead !
the mall that is nearby is not really a mall .
even the atm was boarded up , which is really not a good sign .
there are also not many place to eat around the hotel .
i hate olive garden .
you wo n't find me at an olive garden back in new jersey !
i ordered food that i believed was gluten free .
within twenty minutes i started to have symptoms and was sick for two days .
avoid at all costs !
ever !
thats as american as fortune cookies .
after pasta , comes the protein , that includes meatballs , then finally salad .
i just passed six tables empty and clean .
their salads and breadsticks are the only real reason to go there anymore ... !
well it is a sunday night and the crowd is not here .
very unprofessional staff so far .
her ex must have ran , not walked away from her .
rooms were clean and the amenities were fine .
my problem is that the hotel double charged me for my stay .
i only stayed one night and was charged twice .
add on : the wifi is awful .
no manager on duty for the busy morning rush .
they are not concerned with quality of courtesy services ie shuttle and breakfast .
employees watching reality tv during business hours really puts me off .
the next morning we went down to the front desk again .
something just feels wrong .
avoid .
place is ok but a little uncomfortable .
the continental breakfast was ok but a little lackluster .
so this spot is like mad cheap but really ?
checkin was seamless as it should be .
the first bed legit has hair under the sheets ... strike _num_ .
you could n't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs ?
i assumed it was leaking and brushed it off .
there was absolutely no hot water for my shower .
so cold i would n't even consider hopping in really quick .
i was so mad .
i 'm not sure i can even give this place one star .
furnishings and bedding from the _num_ 's ... if not _num_ 's !
the hallway looks a wreck !
the tv was definitely a _num_ 's model .
there are no hotel signs ; _num_ ) .
there were no parked cars visible from the road ; and _num_ ) .
it looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees .
this was by far the worst hotel experience i 've ever had .
the lights were broken and the room was filthy .
the worst .
do not stay here .
wish i could give this place negative stars .
it begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at .
really wish i would have looked at yelp before booking here .
extremely disappointed .
she could n't tear herself away from the movie to address me .
filthy would be a step up from the actual conditions .
it has n't been cleaned in months .
i explained to her that this has been going on for weeks .
yet again , not one courtesy call , nothing resolved .
i wish i did n't have to give even _num_ star .
horrible service .
i got home and no extra sides .
i called again on july 2nd as they never sent anything .
i would be happy to get my _num_ back .
mediocre food , horrible service , zero follow through .
my advice , avoid this place .
junk worse than mcdonald .
horrible experience again made sandwich wrong for 3rd visit .
store is open until 2:00 .
she asks employee to scale back .
he refuses .
never again will i go to this location .
horrible service !
_num_ time in the row i got my order wrong .
which i do n't really need .
today i gave them _num_ chance .
for real , wasting money for wrong order !
it 's sad .
today both girls behind the counter were so rude and had zero personality .
service is terrible .
waited for _num_ minutes for a bagel with cream cheese with no line .
they other employee was doing i do n't know what .
it should n't take _num_ minutes to get a dozen bagels .
horrible service and food .
horrible customer service and they always screw up our orders .
i just do n't understand why they 're so lazy .
it 's not hard .
extremely long lines , and poorly trained staff .
do not recommend .
the baristas are not friendly .
i 'm always always always made to feel like i 'm stupid ( seriously ?
and they 're just rude .
rude .
real bad .
not like the delicious aroma of fresh brewed coffee .
no no .
and it smells like a coffee shop should smell - like coffee .
it is not daily normal , ordinary dirt .
not sure if the manager makes th e employees clean or not !
would rather go to dunkin donuts next time !
it costs $ _num_ for a manicure and $ _num_ for a pedicure .
the worst mani/pedi of my life .
i 'm _num_ .
she had no clue but claims to have been doing nails for _num_ years .
did n't know how to remove gel polish .
did n't file straight or smooth .
did n't clean under my nails after lotion .
unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened .
unfortunately i do n't know what happened ?
i 'm no longer going back .
i know some people have off days but this was bad .
by far the worst shellac manicure i have ever had .
i went down on my lunch break for a quick mani .
first the woman rushed through my `` manicure . ''
the manicure was very quick and not at all thorough .
if i could give it _num_ stars i would .
i really should have known better to walk in here .
it 's the size of a closet , completely messy , and disorganized .
but you know how some dive bars have charm ?
i was thinking this place might be like that .
i sat down in the chair for pedicure .
that 's not how it 's done in philly .
woman takes off my toe nail polish .
should n't you be doing this for all of your clients ?
shady and terribly run nail salon .
surprised someone has n't been hurt yet .
this is the worse nail salon i have ever been to !
when i said something to her about it , she snapped at me .
she was unprofessional and downright nasty .
this place needs to be closed - stay away !
unfortunately , i did not have the great experience others did .
i ended up getting probably the worst haircut i 'd had in _num_ years .
additionally , the experience at the salon left much to be desired .
something that was supposed to be a treat for me turned into a headache .
the haircut was mediocre , but the highlights were much worse .
they did n't even cover up all of my roots !
i really was sold at one point .
therefore , that left junior stylists to wash and dry my hair .
so please , i trust you to just make me look hot . ''
i hate that !
i 'm not a hair stylist .
we called to make appointments together and the receptionist was rude !
different people wash and dry your hair .
what i got was about _num_ inches taken off and no layers .
wrong !
first , i feel like they pull the prices out of thin air .
finally , overall the prices were way too high .
my husband gave me a gift certificate for this salon .
there were two girls at the front desk , neither could have been bothered .
one did n't even look up from the computer .
she offered me two different stylists by name with no other information .
that 's why i 'm looking for my cup now .
rude .
why did n't i have to show some email to get the free treatment ?
she was basically giving my asian friend a terribly difficult time .
my hairstylist was friendly but gave me a really bad haircut .
very disappointed .
will not return to this place .
once again , they were not prompt .
please do not patronize this business .
i wish it was n't that difficult .
the salon itself also disappointed me .
in addition , they offered me tea , coffee , or water .
however it wasnt until half way through my appointment that i got it .
such a waste of time and rude .
i should have known better given that it only had one positive review .
i wandered in here looking for a pedicure .
my heels still looked as bad as they did when i walked in .
very sloppy !
i would put _num_ star if it was possible !
it looked like a child had done it .
this guy is out of control its definitely something wrong with him .
also a heads up - only _num_ pedicure chairs in the place .
very limited color selection .
very poor quality work .
got a full set and the exact same thing happened _num_ days later .
they must use very cheap product to lower their costs .
pedicure 's are overpriced and they do basically nothing .
it was no more than _num_ minutes long .
do not waste your money .
i 've gotten my nails done quickly before though and had much better quality .
the staff is the most unfriendly and have a carefree attitude .
this is not the first time either .
stuck in my lease until february .
is it terrible ?
no , but you know that better is out there .
the blackened chicken wrap was boring .
the flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland .
also , white tortillas just do not do it for me .
however , i can order a salad with french fries on it .
ca n't win 'em all , right ?
ridiculous .
but , it is what it is so do not forget your key !
other times , it does n't seem so busy .
a number of the reviews here giving off the `` eh '' vibe ?
finally - a halfway decent tv setup , pittsburgh !
my boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and i got a cheddar burger .
he said the stir fry was so-so .
ingredients were spot on , but it was lacking any real flavor .
it was just so-so .
my food was plain and boring .
the place was noisy and it was pricey .
well , it was overpriced and the food was terrible .
i ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room .
very bad food and overpriced .
i wish i could give this place no stars !
no tip for you my friend .
especially considering the french dip was so boring .
no redeeming qualities here .
it was hardly edible .
i did not , however get the best .
although i would have to say the pretzel bite appetizer was n't bad .
but i really do n't think there 's much you can mess up .
the buffalo pierogies however , was a total miss .
it did n't look appetizing , nor did it actually taste appetizing .
food was flavorless , plain .
do they even have tables for _num_ ?
_num_ minutes later ... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there .
no steak knife , no mashed potatoes , no asparagus as ordered .
will not be back .
pirates , steelers , penguins etc ?
they do not have 1/2 price apps !
somewhat slow service and somewhat overpriced .
$ _num_ burgers , $ _num_ domestic bottles .
look elsewhere there is a lot surrounding this place so you have options .
we waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus .
absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner .
and all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty !
the nachos were the worst i 've ever had .
noisy overcrowded and not enough staff to cover the crowd so service was slow .
the lobster bisque was bland and cold .
the pork chop was so bitter and dry .
furthermore , it took forever just to get our waitress 's attention .
i would rather go get sushi than spend more money here .
i was disappointed the waitress did n't say anything either .
unfortunately , our experience was dreadful .
our food tasted frozen and overcooked .
what has not changed is the extremely poor service .
our meal basically met our admittedly low expectations .
all working hard , but covering too many tables .
long story short , i wo n't go back .
she thought the potato side was just so-so .
hotel restaurants are just awful !
would n't they want you to stay and spend money on their property ?
nevertheless , this place in the westin hotel is no different .
for starters , the place is sorely outdated .
the decorations look like they 're straight out of an _num_ 's music video .
the spicy yellow tail was not spicy .
the salad 's ginger dressing was awful and watery .
but it was not happening at this place !
and def not as good !
it was hardly halfway full .
so she asked for a little more from the server .
needless to say , i will not be back .
do n't say i did n't warn you !
the portions are not worth the price .
the service has been poor almost every time i went .
the salads are small and nothing to write about .
came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service .
do n't waste your time at the fish market .
_num_ dollars for _num_ people .
it all had no taste !
the steak was tough and tasteless .
there was too much rice , and presentation was sad .
service was the only redeeming quality .
a simple `` sorry for the wait '' would have been nice .
unfortunately we did not .
the food was all bland and tasteless .
it was not even blackened .
mash potatoes were dry and tasted gritty like it came from a box .
do yourself a favor and avoid the original fish market .
a round of patron margaritas were horrible .
fish market needs some lessons on hospitality and diversity or new management .
terrible crab bisque .
the food was awful .
do not waste your money at this restaurant .
seriously , terrible .
just all around terrible .
it actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright .
i 've been meaning to go back to the fish market for so long .
i finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed .
both were not unique in flavor or presentation .
ugly .
ugly .
ugly .
i was pretty disappointed by this experience .
it was n't good at all .
it was a small roll cut into _num_ pieces ( maki ) .
so i know it 's an off the shelf thing .
basically , this was the worst roll i could imagine .
so all-in-all , the food was sub-par at best .
i 'm sure the room service would have been better .
to be fair there was n't anything particularly wrong with the food or service .
but the quality just does n't match the price .
first time i 've eaten here i went during lunch time .
not crowded but service was quite slow so i took off a star .
you 're probably asking why order that when at a fish market .
no worries probably better for me .
so they lost another star for over priced for the value i received .
the girlfriends sushi meal was a bit over priced for a lunch menu .
two basic rolls and miso soup for $ _num_ .
this would easy go for $ _num_ at other places during lunch .
yes , but only if it is convenient .
i would not go out of my way or tell friends about this place .
did n't eat here ... this review not about the food .
we immediately left and frankly its not worth going back again .
shame , the fish was good there .
crappy hostess for sure .
it does n't change much .
they get maximum money for average seafood ( or anything else ) .
the miso soup was barely average .
sub-par sushi .
no greeter so we were n't sure where to go .
the rest was dry .
it was disgusting .
she however did not offer to comp the meal .
we sat down for lunch after checking into our hotel room .
not good .
the food was ok , but nothing special .
it 's a shame b/c better service would have made the experience decent .
go somewhere else for lunch , there are many better options in the area .
the food on the other hand - absolutely horrible .
so disappointed with this place !
the menu was pretty random and everything we tried was really average .
the drinks were n't anything special either .
never been before and went on a thursday night at 6pm before a show .
i 'm sure it is in the liquor license application .
not my scene whatsoever !
super bad energy in this place .
i did n't even say goodbye to the friend who had brought me there .
smoke bomb disappeared !
she knew i would hate it but just did n't want to go alone .
i was pissed .
the night was not lost .
i am not saying that people who like this place are any particular sort .
thats pretty lame for a downtown bar just because they were not packed .
extremely disappointed .
i 've been going to this bar randomly over the last _num_ years .
it 's definitely gone downhill .
there were maybe _num_ people around the bar .
but the attitude of this place could be better .
the menu was small and underwhelming .
the flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box .
obviously , if you choose to patronize this establishment , pay cash .
the guys here were borderline rude to me when i dropped my car off .
so really it was n't a terribly difficult job to be done .
i could have saved a lot of money and time and done it myself .
wo n't come again to this place ... .
do n't bother .
it was boring and flavor free .
oh , and the grocery store wine was way over priced .
food was fine , wo n't go back for fear of the server .
while here , we sampled the blueberry mojito and the cucumber basil martini .
the blueberry mojito had an overpowering taste of rum .
however , the rum killed any blueberry or mint flavor in the drink .
the sole basil flavor of this drink made it unappealing .
ok , i 'm in !
i figured wrong .
well hell , what was your first guess ?
i ordered some turkey wrap with a fruit salad for a side .
i say `` some '' turkey wrap because it was really that unimpressive !
when it did , it looked ok .
it was very disappointing .
however , i 'm mainly rating their food and service .
in fact , i could n't finish it .
we both threw down a brew nasty , paid and left .
unfortunately for olive or twist , the visit would probably be our last .
my biggest complaint is the drink prices .
it 's somewhat upscale , but it 's not the ritz .
owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal .
this bar is cramped , overpriced , and the service is unbelievably slow .
seriously , avoid this place .
very disappointed .
it was frustrating .
unfortunately , they were very disappointing .
her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm .
thankfully i just dislike tomatoes and it was n't an allergy issue .
there was also no pineapple chutney .
overall , very disappointed .
but the positives stop there .
neither one of us ate more than _num_ chips .
completely bitter and disgusting !
do n't go here for anything but the walls and music .
we both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps .
my first impression was the outdated decor .
the restaurant has carpet which i find off putting .
the food was mediocre .
visited with a party of _num_ last weekend for a friend 's birthday .
can you say awkward ?
we went back in the main door , clearly confused .
the bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks ( rude ! )
we were seated , and had to wait awhile for service .
i was too drunk and full of pita donuts to eat my dinner .
the two bites of my pork belly sandwich were pretty alright though .
this time was not so good .
no problem , we were seated right away .
anything to acknowledge an unacceptable wait time .
we did n't get anything , and that was a little disappointing .
not a fan of the service .
it literally killed me to leave a tip .
guess the men at olive or twist only like men .
$ _num_ bill and it was n't good at all !
the customer service displayed was some of the worst i have ever seen .
the food was underwhelming at best .
no acknowledgement when we arrive .
asked to leave my card at the bar .
never came out to see how we were doing .
worst service i 've received in a while .
i would n't go if you are of flavor descent .
i asked the waitress ... did n't this come with the mango salsa topping ?
why did n't they do that in the first place .
maybe it 's nostalgia for the cigar but i thought he looked ridiculous .
there 's a reason it cost that , because it was n't very good .
the sauce was disappointing .
i would n't come here for anything .
we 'll feed these to our dogs when we get home .
avoid this tourist trap !
first time in pittsburgh , from chicago .
no one seems to know how the public transportation system works .
why do i need to request a stop on the `` t '' ?
oh , pat buses , why ca n't i quit you ?
why does n't the schedule know this ?
i was _num_ minutes early for the bus i was trying to catch .
i can understand a delay during rush hour , but this was not .
for shame !
i do n't even really know where to begin with this review .
well , it does get one from point a to point b in pittsburgh .
there 's no day pass .
i have been riding the bus for as long as i can remember .
anyway port authority to sum it up , is a hot damn mess .
one year after they cut that route after being there over _num_ years .
its only been in new york and dc for years !
getting on and off is confusing .
when to pay is confusing .
the service is n't frequent enough .
the subway system only goes to one neighborhood from downtown .
the buses smell like urine .
sucks , sucks , sucks .
on an _num_ degree day one buses heat was on full blast .
not the drivers fault .
buses are late all the time .
port authority sucks !
they have the worst transportation service ever in pittsburgh .
they also cut back bus services and lay off all these bus drivers .
pathetic !
pittsburgh is known for their worst transportation !
the bus number is _num_ .
i wish someone had informed the port authority of this .
_num_ . )
singapore had this for their buses in _num_ !
_num_ . )
some drivers can be surly or just downright ignorant .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
i waited two hours today in the freezing cold to get to work .
had to call off it was just to cold out !
considering the size of pittsburgh , the bus system here is actually pathetic .
so why not actually make a decent public transportation system ?
finally , drivers range from super friendly to scary or just rude .
one , quite literally , threw a guy off of the bus for me .
it varies bus by bus , time of day , and more .
* wasting over an hour of my time .
big league cities need big league transportation .
_num_ stars ?
what i found most annoying was the uncomfortable seating .
okay , i 'm not from pittsburgh .
nothing was dry ?
half my dish was potato .
there was seriously nothing remotely healthy on this menu .
nothing raw , nothing green , nothing fresh , not even as an ingredient .
_num_ fights broke out while we were there .
anyway - i wo n't be heading back anytime soon !
avis customer service says we have to wait _num_ hours .
thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars .
i rented a car with this location as the drop off point .
i signed all paper work and returned the keys .
i became very angry .
worst customer service at this place .
no grace period or understanding at all .
she was as useless as a tsa agent .
why did n't i get paid then ?
i 'm not from here , so maybe i do n't share the love .
i probably wo n't be back ever again .
i thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird .
totally not worth it , unless you just go for the fries and drinks .
unfortunately , this place is pretty dirty .
make sure no flies land on your food .
unfortunately , i learned this the hard way .
i recently ate a _num_ oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint .
that was the worst meat that i have seen since junior high school .
we would have been much better off at burger king .
worst sandwich on earth .
oh primanti 's , you always disappoint !
_num_ these guys can never seem to cook their fries properly .
_num_ the bread .
maybe we just went to the wrong primanti bros location .
gross !
many people told me to go here and i was totally disappointed !
okay on to service ... everyone seemed like they hated their job .
it was really , really , not good .
so i guess if you want an authentic pittsburgh experience then go here .
i do n't care to ever go back and will tell friends to avoid .
in philly , they 'd be out of business in a heartbeat .
a native sent me here , an apparent pittsburgh landmark .
what i got was a very dry and tasteless sandwich .
service was indifferent , at best .
my first time at primanti bros in pittsburgh , pa .
i was not impressed with my sandwich there .
i think with some mustard this might have been great .
it was dry .
after sitting there and being ignored for _num_ minutes we just left !
rude , arrogant , and just nasty .
i do n't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place .
when i told people i was going to pittsburgh , everyone recommended primanti bros .
it was a big sandwich , but the flavour was not amazing .
i also ordered a bowl of chili which was too spicy for me .
i do n't like coleslaw .
you 'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it .
the sandwich at best was mediocre .
apart from that , i do n't know why you 'd return .
2nd experience , today , equally as awful .
their fries are also soggy and gross .
the sheer size of it all was just too much too .
the concept is n't that ridiculous either .
just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich .
the only flavors were vinegar and pepper .
( did i mention they tasted like old fryer grease ? )
the sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive .
be warned that everything here comes with french fries , even the salads .
they are soggy and tasteless , maybe the worst i 've ever had .
half the sandwich falls out while your eating .
ordered a grilled chicken salad , take out .
i only go there when dragged by coworkers .
lack of flavor really hurts them in my opinion .
it really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients .
i really do n't know what the hype is about .
i was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant .
but then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me .
i immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again mia .
she just disappeared again .
i waited as long as i could but she never came back .
until then she was just missing .
i had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it .
i was really annoyed .
i no longer have to carry around my terrible , terrible secret .
to be honest this place was not that good at all .
the sandwiches , although unique , were not that good .
it was all french fries and very little meat .
what a disappointment .
maybe my expectations were just too high , i do n't know .
previous reviews have said it well : lackluster , tasteless food .
boring sandwich .
so , why such a low score ?
the service was terrible .
have n't you been to any restaurants , like , ever ?
sit back down and i 'll take your order . ''
it was unbelievable .
utterly , totally unbelievable .
the chicken was like tasteless rubber .
i ca n't for the life of me figure out why all the hype .
i was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat .
but i 'm a tourist here , and wanted to try it .
it was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries .
the thick white bread was dry and boring ; too crusty .
he gave me big time attitude and commented that i took it apart .
and that , sir , is why you got a $ _num_ tip !
they left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich !
nope , wo n't be back .
disappointed , big time .
the sandwich was soggy , bland , and just all-around not good .
i did n't get sick from it , so that 's a bonus .
go to meat & potatoes instead , and order a sandwich there .
tonight was my second attempt here .
not even an acknowledgement from the wait staff .
no more tries here .
to compare this place to the famous sandwich places is nyc is a joke .
if you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them , go for it .
but no good sandwich needs nonsense like that .
i was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed !
everything was bland , nothing had seasoning , not even basic salt .
however , they only have two waitresses outside for about _num_ tables .
it took _num_ minutes to get our drink order .
our waitress was very rude and did n't make me feel welcomed at all .
it 's not fair for the customers or for the servers .
_num_ stars for history , _num_ for food quality and flavor .
in total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food .
if you do n't have the time just go next door to the subway .
i stand by my decision : pass .
she came back _num_ minutes later , with the beers and took our order .
when we did finally get our food , it was ice cold .
i had very little meat in mine , and more coleslaw that anything else .
why the hell are you in such a hurry '' .
had such high hopes for this place on our visit to pittsburgh .
worst service ever .
can i give this place zero stars ?
gross . )
this place was trashy , dirty and probably not even up to code .
my first visit was to the one in south hills .
waited _num_ mins for _num_ sandwiches .
the coleslaw is gross and i 'm a fan of coleslaw .
this time i got the grilled chicken salad .
the chicken was tasteless and rubbery .
it , however , did n't work for me .
it 's not much of a cheesesteak .
i ca n't hold it against them though .
i chose poorly .
this sandwich shop lacks all of those things .
highly disappointing .
bland .
service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made .
coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce i smothered on it .
the beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating .
i 'm not a big foodie but i like my food taste better .
the market square location has the most horrible service i 've ever experienced .
horrible !
will never return to any location !
service was bad .
highly disappointing philly cheesesteak !
first , we were disappointed by how many places were closed on a sunday .
the only reason i 'm giving it two stars is because of the bread .
i asked if she had pbr , and she replied she did n't know .
ok then , how about i just have a diet pop .
before she ran off , we ordered our meals .
and then just stood there waiting to write my order down .
it was just strange .
of course , the order came out quickly , and wrong .
getting those taken off was another huge inconvenience to our poor server .
my aunt picked up lunch , and left the tip .
outside of the bread i ca n't say it was memorable in any way .
basically , this place is like dr. pepper soda .
people are crazy about it but that thing tastes extremely ridiculous .
ok , i get it , your busy .
so , after all was said and done , my sandwich was just ok .
nothing to write home about .
sorry , i guess it 's just not my thing .
i do n't care for primanti brothers .
the sandwiches are n't bad , they just are n't great .
the main ingredients just seem to be lacking in quality .
my other issue is their restaurants are all filthy .
i 've been to _num_ different primanti locations and each one just seems greasy .
place sucks .
this was after waiting 20+ minutes at the register with cash in hand .
rude !
not worth it .
very bad foods .
very bad service .
they were rude .
i do not recommend this place .
that being said , this place was not good .
firstly , the food had no flavor .
that has nothing to do with our party size .
the only seasoning available are salt , pepper , hot sauce , & ketchup .
big disappointment .
neither i nor my husband understood the hype about this place .
we 'd probably never go back .
i do n't understand the hype with this place .
the sandwiches they serve are gross !
super dry and no good flavor other than the cole slaw .
the only thing this place has going for it is the local hype .
the coleslaw lacked flavor and the bun was simple white bread .
the fries on the sandwich added no additional flavor .
hate slaw but tried it with slaw anyway .
nothing special .
way too much coleslaw .
def split it and get ice cream for dessert somewhere else .
only good part was an outdoor concert going on just outside of it !
for both sandwiches , the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale .
the veggies were about average , not fresh , but did n't taste gross .
essentially , the entire sandwich was inedible and i settled for five guys instead .
nothing special .
so , i got a turkey sandwich with the coleslaw and fries on it .
too many fries on the sandwich .
oh , and like _num_ slices of meat and a slice of cheese .
i 've been here three times and it 's been inconsistent .
they really overload the sandwiches with coleslaw and french fries .
i end up picking half of my sandwich apart .
it looked pretty awful like a hard , dry , high school cafeteria lunch .
i would n't recommend this place .
we ordered the `` pitt burger '' and boy was it disappointing .
the burger is dry and lacks flavor .
the bread was the worst part .
ugh .
trust the reviews , it 's not worth the wait or the money !
it 's just bad .
the servers are polite , but extremely inattentive .
came here after a _num_ 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich i ever had .
the sandwich sucked ; no flavor , no excitement .
and the beer menu was mediocre , at best .
on the other hand , the fried pickles were great .
and the wait staff were awesome .
also , parking was shit .
my advice : locals must not know shit from their asshole .
this place really did suck .
i sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich .
she has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in _num_ minutes .
for the most part they were rude and inattentive .
it is not .
disgusting .
guests always mention they ca n't wait to try go here .
i dread it at this point .
wrong .
never going back .
for one , the service was terrible .
the food sucks .
you will leave smelling like cooking oil .
and their beer selection sucks .
horrible customer service !
but the dipping sauce for the tots were on point .
there is very little meat on the sandwich .
service is n't that great either .
for all the hype this was very disappointing .
skip it .
not a fan of the french bread .
wo n't be coming back after this visit .
i am visiting from california and was very disappointed with the service and food .
it was all bread and coleslaw .
the waiter was not nice at all !
each time , i ask myself , `` why am i going back ? ''
it was grilled chicken , french fries , a little cheese on chopped lettuce .
the bread is _num_ % of the meal .
not so much .
my friend got an italian sub that was ok .
skip this place - there are other decent cheap eats downtown .
upon entering you are immediately greeted by pure chaos .
the service is horrible ... friendly but horrible .
i ordered two double cheeseburgers and waited over twenty minutes for them .
this mcdonalds is straight crap .
the staff does n't seem to care .
he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
they sit on tables and often just sit at your table .
he make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly .
they sit on the tables and often just sit at your table .
i think this should be more like _num_ stars .
the preparation instructions seem questionable ( microwave in a plastic bag ?
being from la , i was disappointed with the tacos .
unfortunately , it was not as good as i hoped .
the cashier had no idea what we were asking for .
... can you call back later , i 'm really busy . ''
finally they figure it out and give us the roasted chile .
oh wait though .
it 's horrible .
i wo n't be going back .
i have been there _num_ times .
food ok but service ... ... horrible !
he got our salsa order wrong so needless to say , we left .
this makes me sad to write this .
did they bite off more than they can chew ?
completely unacceptable and disgusting to sell such expired food to your customers .
check the expiration dates on all purchase from here !
she over charged us for her very badly made drinks .
the food and drinks are very over priced for what it is .
omg what a nightmare .
the second time , though , was tonight , valentine 's day .
it was n't very crowded , so we were seated right away .
they were n't dressed how i would have expected them to be .
but , our waitress was helpful , and our food came out pretty quickly .
it was n't a memorable meal or experience .
the bleu cheese dressing , though , tasted pretty good .
i 'm not a fan of that .
the seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible .
the staff is rude .
the prices are too high for the quality .
just all around disappointing .
i wo n't be back .
went to this place for lunch last saturday , party of five .
and the waitress did n't return until after we were done eating .
horrible service and horrible food !
it took _num_ minutes for our waitress to even come to our table !
the crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and i had to switch meals .
i could n't even taste the crab !
the fish and chips looked great but it did n't taste like anything !
a complete waste of $ _num_ .
my husband and i went tonight for dinner .
bad mistake .
worst meal we 've ever had .
busy , slow and awful .
the air conditioning was non existent , which is a hangover nightmare .
i 'm not a beer drinking novice .
bland .
i should n't have to ask for napkins at the point of need .
no tip , never coming back .
service gets _num_ stars and food gets _num_ stars .
overall , this place gets a _num_ stars .
then again , we were in pittsburgh , so it 's a given .
the waitress was slow getting around to us .
i wo n't be back .
first , all of the food was extremely overpriced .
i could n't have tried to make food this poor .
extremely slow service !
i would give this restaurant _num_ stars if i could .
i do n't even know where to begin .
service was horrible .
the lunch took _num_ hours .
it was not .
it was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top .
and a side salad at almost $ _num_ .
not worth it .
just awful .
what a complete disaster .
we were both craving seafood , and had never been here before .
needless to say , we were unable to take advantage of any specials .
anyway , we sip our disappointing drinks and decide to order an appetizer .
we did not feel any of these things .
it 's not like they were busy .
in short , i do not believe we will be dining here again .
this place was terrible .
the seafood tasted old .
the bathrooms were gross and probably never clean .
i am just hoping that i do n't get food poisoning later tonight .
why on earth did i go back to this restaurant ?
clearly , i must not love myself or something .
want to pay too much money for fish that smells like a sewer ?
there were _num_ of us on a beautiful sunday afternoon .
with _num_ waitresses .
the fish was hot and crispy .
but the clams casino were inedible .
the clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping .
the crab cakes were also bad .
it took _num_ minutes to get someone to take the bill .
poor service .
took _num_ minutes before someone came to take our drink order .
took another _num_ minutes to get the drinks .
the waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready .
not worth wasting your time .
went on a wednesday night , not crowded at all .
service was just awful .
no he did n't !
the fish sandwich arrived nearly _num_ minutes before the rest of our meals .
i will give them hell . ''
service was terrible .
brick oven pizza cold ... .
asked to have it reheated , still came back cold .
steak was way over cooked .
was not busy but waitress was hard to find .
would not go back and would not recommend this place to anyone .
friends warned me not to eat here .
this was just awful , start to finish .
and a generally miserable experience .
and this was an early lunch with very few customers around .
are you kidding me ?
that 's not a lobster roll !
the `` lobster '' was sparse , tough , and flavorless .
at $ _num_ each this falls clearly into the ripoff category .
and trying to get our check ?
ridiculous .
i wo n't be back .
we did n't realize most of the restaurants are closed on mondays .
tried thin man , closed .
however , the last few times we have been there it has been terrible .
while the food remains okay , the service leaves something to be desired .
the waitress was rude and less than helpful .
our _num_ drink and lunch took over two hours to complete .
diner _num_ - ordered the lobster roll sandwich .
nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this .
bland and awful .
diner _num_ - steamed clams .
diner _num_ - ordered the salad with the lobster roll , hold the bread .
why the need to put lobster in a dye ?
sent the mussels back .
rest rooms are dirty , and smell of urine .
you have been warned ... stay away !
if _num_ stars were possible i 'd give em .
just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off .
look on his face - totally rude and completely inept .
i was hard put to give _num_ % tip to be honest .
you will only get frustrated with the slow as hell service .
suggestions , hmm not entirely sure since nothing i ate here impressed me much .
_num_ were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered _num_ .
_num_ more minutes for drinks , and to order .
i 've tried and tried to give this place a chance .
the oysters were absolutely disgusting .
they were not fresh , or cleaned very well .
as always , the service was terrible .
never again will i spend money in this place .
service was great , however , the food was mediocre .
they had to be cooked prior to us ordering , or even getting there .
the burger was just eh .
overall , this joint was not that great .
waited for about _num_ minutes at the entrance .
no hostess coming up .
she did not apologize and says that it will take another _num_ minutes .
i just did n't feel satisfied at the end of my meal .
and it was cold - did n't even take my winter coat off .
so , needless to say , not the best experience .
overall , my experience was okay .
we got the scallop appetizer and it was to die for !
i will _num_ % go back for that !
that being said , it was downhill from there .
i 'll go back for the scallops , but would n't recommend anything else .
the beer choices and the casual menu was right up my alley .
unfortunately the food was not .
ca n't recommend the place .
waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy .
waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave .
i noticed the beer sampler and thought i would give it a try .
they were cold but did not taste fresh .
the lobster inside was a small amount , cold and tough .
the slaw was reasonably good and cold .
i would be hard pressed to ever return .
stopped in on the fourth of july for evening cocktail and small meal .
from horrible service to terrible seafood ... would never return .
um , no ... it was more like garbage sewer sauce .
mussels were freezing cold .
how can a seafood place serve terrible seafood ?
this place is terrible .
spend your money somewhere else .
she brought our soups , which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls .
poor excuse for seafood !
unless you sit at the bar , the service is poor .
is n't even that great at the bar .
the place is gross !
i liked the bar .
overcooked and dry , dry , dry .
this lobster was dry and chewy .
lots of it , though i guess that accounts for the high price .
then the other day , we went back and i tried pizza .
the toppings were terrible ( pepperoni , sausage .
super disappointed in this place .
when the food arrived it was mediocre at best .
will not be coming back to this place unless i 'm dragged .
they may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a saturday night .
i think one star is being highly generous for this restaurant .
it was by far the worst experience at a restaurant i have had .
it was disgusting .
this was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant .
do n't waste your time here , especially if you have kids .
oh and less than stellar fries , with a cup of cole slaw .
ugh if i could give this place _num_ stars i would .
what a nightmare .
after almost an hour of waiting , i still had no pizza .
you do not deserve this job and should be fired .
after reading reviews i was afraid of what kind of service we would encounter .
i would n't order food here , again .
this place is less than mediocre .
visited on a friday night and it was pretty crowded .
the clam chowder was just ok .
like , i was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing .
not worth the bucks .
life is too short for less than mediocre food .
absolutely a waste of time and money .
service is just terrible .
the food was terrible and way overpriced .
just awful .
the restaurant was too busy .
the bathrooms were atrocious .
it 's never horrible .
has n't made me sick , again .
i do n't eat seafood often so i would n't know .
service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either .
kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd .
huge portion .
despite the size , the flavor was lacking as well as texture .
they used real garlic and it was served with it - minced .
looks better than it tastes .
there were _num_ of us and they brought out three .
my salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders .
no soup for me apparently .
no bueno .
unless your are here for a beer , forget about it .
i tried one but could not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay .
the person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich .
no fish .
terrible experience here .
the mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible .
it was awful .
i got the lobster roll and was really disappointed .
did n't even offer a food menu .
paid for the lousy $ _num_ beer and got up .
there was only _num_ bartender working so the service was a little slow .
the food was bland at best .
alas , the bisque tasted like wheat paste .
on wet cardboard .
maybe i just ate the box ?
else , you will find better value and experience elsewhere .
i did n't think it could get any worse ... .
i witnessed more apologies to customers that day than i ever have .
it was n't even crowded .
it took _num_ minutes just to get our waters .
i had to spit the oyster out in a napkin .
the food , however , was disappointing .
it looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
then i tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway .
that , for me , ruined my whole meal .
no amount of butter and salt could save that corn .
my bf got the steak with battered shrimp .
waited to be seated for _num_ minutes , no one greeted us .
she walked up the stairs and ignored us .
needless to say , we will not be returning to this place .
never going back , letting our bank handle this one .
super slow , cold fries , freezer burned carrots , rubbery lobster claws .
wait , ceasar salad was ok !
no stars !
great shrimp cocktail but i wish i had my fish sandwich across the street .
my overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced .
anyone who had french fries said they were cold .
the mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best , and the vegetables were cold .
the only good thing about the experience was the beer selection .
for a $ _num_ meal each , not great .
i will remember to never return while i 'm in pittsburgh .
horrible atmosphere for the food on the menu in parts .
they charge like $ _num_ for this , which is a complete ripoff .
here on vacation and the waitress seemed annoyed we wanted food .
lobster roll was dry and salty .
if anyone had asked , i would have shared these comments .
lack of chicken and brown , mushy lettuce .
i see why this place is hurting for business .
terribly salty `` lobster roll '' on greasy bread .
needless to say we wo n't be back !
literally disgusting .
their food is gross and i 've seen nice running around in there .
no host and the bartender asked if we were going to eat .
ordered the lobster mac n cheese as an appetizer .
for dinner i ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes .
extremely disappointed in this dish .
then , my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza .
it was nasty .
my chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken .
horrible experience .
this is one of the worst experiences i have had at a restaurant .
they squeezed _num_ people into _num_ small tables given the restaurant was fairly empty .
the only way to describe the food is disgusting .
-i split the giant beer battered fish sandwich .
the fries were cold , and the sandwich and fries were very greasy .
between two of them they finished one piece and could n't tolerate anymore .
i tried a bite of it .
the waiter was terrible .
overall the food , service , and atmosphere deserve _num_ star .
i would not recommend them .
so why just a `` _num_ star '' rating ?
terrible service !
told _num_ minute wait for food .
sarcastic bartender and place half empty .
the steamed mussels arrived in a grey broth that looked like sewage water .
the crab cakes were cold and overly salty .
what a horrible experience .
thankfully , our later stops were much better .
my appetizer was cajun shrimp , which was way over seasoned .
i could n't even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of cajun seasoning .
the mashed potatoes were great , everyone agreed on that .
the bathrooms were disgusting .
this is probably the worst review of a restaurant i 've ever written .
but this place was just awful .
terrible tuxedo rentals !
when i picked it up , it did not fit !
poor excuse for a gentleman 's store .
oh , and its very very expensive !
the staff at the downtown location tend to be rude .
dark roasted , bitter , etc .
rude .
he did n't make a comment but i thought , rude .
what i received was a whole milk latte .
she said `` fine '' ( rude ) .
but this is n't what i ordered .
and am not a fan of the _num_ % .
rude .
so very rude .
that was not a real latte .
it 's sometimes tough to get waited on even with nobody in the store .
she clearly has no clue , pride or care in coffee making .
unfortunately , mike & tony 's closes by 6pm .
cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal .
the fries were cooked to perfection , but lacked flavor .
the gyro itself was mediocre .
the slice of chocolate cake , while a descent size , was rather tasteless .
she apparently had no time to take a wet cloth the the tables .
i kind of felt bad for her .
the food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch .
they are open late hours , so sometimes that can be handy .
it sits in the warmer cases , and looks `` crusty '' .
owners should know how they are being represented at the front register .
it is cheap food , and you get what you pay for .
it was very cold inside the restaurant .
my husbands pork was a small portion .
it was very inexpensive and i understand why .
wo n't go back or recommend it .
my dad and i walked in around _num_ pm on a friday night .
the dining room was about half full .
people just seemed to be standing around this whole place for no reason .
sucks .
why post a closing time if it is n't honored ?
this is an odd little cvs .
this was my first time trying brown bag deli too .
this was one of the most disgusting restaurants ive ever been in .
so , i decided to sit outside as i had already ordered my food .
then , i go to check out , my dinner was $ _num_ .
i hated it !
followed with an arrogant face !
please ... .
the only restaurant that gave me so rude , unprofessional answer ever !
oh my god ... .
should i really tell him how much he deserved ?
this place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising .
overall the food was hit or miss .
the most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat .
my companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable .
all patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross .
even homemade wine and honey soaked cake wo n't bring me back again .
this place was really gross .
the olives were even disgusting -- how do you mess up olives ?
the bill was way too high .
if you really hate someone , you should take them to this restaurant .
dirty , unclean , my friend and i went to lunch here .
this place is below par in just about every way .
i asked for my check and barely ate anything .
do n't bother with this place !
i wo n't go back .
the hummus is a little bland .
my issue was the price , $ _num_ .
my boyfriend and i decided to split the platter , which was horrible .
mostly negative , but hey i was hungry and gave it a shot .
i declined that after reading is was mediocre at best .
* the owner failed to mention the pita bread was extra .
it tasted worse than it looked ( if that was possible ) .
tough cheese mostly tasteless and chewy .
another mistake was sitting outside when they are trying to bring people in .
i ordered the chicken kabob .
very bland and it actually tasted baked not grilled .
i did n't finish it .
the spinach pie was ok .
bland again and very chewy .
it did n't taste fresh , almost frozen at one point and microwaved .
the cheese pie was pretty bad .
i will not go again .
better than nothing , i suppose .
none of our food was good .
a struggling business is always sad to see .
but with all of the strange behavior , attempts to scam us , etc .
too slow service .
was waiting for my check about _num_ minutes .
annoying waiter .
i 'm not sure if this is working hard or just desperate .
_num_ ) the owner is pushy .
_num_ ) the portions are small !
_num_ ) the lemonade is _num_ % ice !
_num_ ) $ _num_ tip even though the owner is the server .
stay away and never look back .
i had spaghetti and meatballs and a caesar salad .
normally i hate salads in places like this .
the lettuce tastes old and rubbery ... not in this case .
find something ... anything else ... it is going to disappoint .
service is lacking and food is mediocre .
no thanks .
disappointed .
however , neither were great .
in fact the room we sat in had approximately _num_ open tables .
just my _num_ cents .
do n't get me wrong ... the food is not atrocious .
but it certainly is sub-par .
the service was mediocre .
it has gone downhill badly .
the last visit last night was the third strike and sw is out !
very poor service and food .
the drinks were all ice and refills were not timely .
this is the strip district after all with many stores for crying out loud .
the food was very poor .
my wild mushroom and chicken was not warm but tasted okay .
we will not be going back .
why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me .
anyway , i ordered the wild mushroom pasta with chicken .
the sauce was really disgusting .
thank you for your feedback regarding your visit to spaghetti warehouse .
your comments have been sent to our general manager , christopher beers .
their service is a hot mess !
just getting our drinks out was confusing .
for our dinner , we were given a salad , entree , & tiramisu .
it did n't taste fresh at all .
there was a list of _num_ or so entrees we could choose from .
i unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo -- worst ever .
i could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar .
the tiramisu also was gross .
i 've never been to one & was really excited .
seriously though , their food is so bad .
it tasted like it came out of a walmart freezer on clearance .
wo n't be coming back anytime soon .
came here later in the evening on a weekday to an empty building .
the food left much the be desired .
the service was the worst i 've ever encountered .
needless to say we did not return to redeem it .
overall , i 've got no complaints about the food .
but there was no one there .
after waiting way too long to even be acknowledged , my order was taken .
skip to the second time .
while this is happening , several waitresses come to the bar to get drinks .
i was a little salty with her , i 'll admit .
this place is dead , but they just do n't know it yet .
a couple tables taken , but no sign of staff in the bar .
not a table in the bar area had been cleaned in that period .
and the restaurant is empty !
maybe _num_ % full !
they made us wait simply because they ca n't staff correctly .
no wonder it is _num_ % empty but still makes people wait .
as my review makes clear , i ca n't compare the food .
and i am certainly not a fan of the olive garden .
you ca n't screw up pasta -- it would be very hard .
our waiter ( vincent ) had _num_ tables .
i gave him my drink order and then he asked for our dinner order .
why would you not just get our drinks ?
not terrible .
true , this is n't capital grill , nor was i expecting 5-star service .
i did n't even know what fine dining was until college .
the worst service ever .
it was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress .
the food was mediocre at best .
total waste of money .
i went here after seeing a musical and it was terrible .
my sister sent hers back because it was cold .
the place is old and outdated , and the restrooms were horrible .
save your money and make spaghetti at home !
they are understaffed , incompetent , and slow .
it was like getting waited on by 1st job people .
it 's tacky too hot .
they play pop music and it 's supposed to be an italian place .
very very slow service and no authenticity in the meals .
im from california and was excited to experience this restaurant .
unfortunately what i got tasted like a canned sauce with minced onions .
as much as i hate olive garden ... i would preferred that .
ca n't give this place anything lower than _num_ star .
all our food was the thrown together in the same pan .
not worth the $ _num_ .
worst place ever .
we talked to the manager i 'm assuming which did n't really care .
said hopefully we come back because service is n't usually this bad .
we hopped this was a one off and not typical .
avoid this place at all costs !
nothing i had tasted good .
just skip it .
nothing special .
did n't seem handmade or anything like that .
service was incredibly slow .
i probably would n't go back .
the wedding soup was the worst i have ever had .
the meat balls had absolute no taste , kind of like cardboard .
the spaghetti tasted no different than boxed pasta .
our garlic bread came out literally black .
i ca n't even believe somebody would serve that .
we will not be back .
every dish had several things wrong with it .
even the bread was stale .
mushy spaghetti drenched in the worst sauce i ever had .
i wish it were possible to give this place _num_ stars .
they 're wrong .
the pasta is consistently overcooked .
the service is not only poor , but the staff are rude .
i will not visit this restaurant again .
i 'm not italian , but i cook way better than this myself .
there was a little bit of a wait which is expected on saturday night .
my son 's macaroni and cheese was salty and cold .
this place is a disaster .
the service is really spotty too .
pros : never a dull moment .
the whole experience can be both amusing and depressing at the same time .
baked ziti average .
dont like too soft pasta , al dente preferred .
i was not impressed at all .
he seemed to be in a bad mood and made us feel uncomfortable .
however , food wise , it was just ok and a bit disappointing .
i of course had filet , and i was just so underwhelmed with it .
the flavor was meh and the black truffle butter was surprisingly boring .
they are taken over by a very large mega restaurant chain corporation .
gone is the famous gm bill .
changed too seem to be the quality of the steaks .
the meat was n't special .
the deserts were ok but the creme brulee was bland in the extreme .
service was ok but occasionally inattentive .
my biggest gripe , though , would be the overcooked scallops .
wow , not so much .
very strange experience .
the food was bland .
nothing to write home about .
i dined at morton 's last night jan _num_ , _num_ .
the food was not good .
i feel i paid $ _num_ for a $ _num_ meal .
service was great but it sure was n't morton 's quality ?
what the hell is going on people ?
omg , the cheese cake ( at $ _num_ ) was very dry .
$ _num_ is not working for me .
his side of mac and cheese was laughable .
i 'd have to say i was pretty disappointed with my overall experience .
the sides left much to be desired .
i ordered steamed broccoli and he ordered mashed potatoes .
we had to send the potatoes back because they were cold .
do n't believe i will be returning here unless it 's free !
terrible value but the steaks were good .
$ _num_ caesar salad with tasteless dressing that probably came out of a bottle .
$ _num_ side dishes .
probably the worst value around .
we had dinner tonight and were so disappointed .
the food was bland at best .
the only thing that was efficient was the valet service .
the service is here so incredibly inconsistent .
the way you are treated is sub par .
the entire staff was rude .
the downtown office has ruined america 's best for me forever .
the customer service here is horrible .
i feel like everything i say is wrong .
very poor customer service at this location .
$ _num_ down the drain .
it was a horrible experience .
if only they could train their employees better .
there was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub .
the washer and dryer was old .
the sofa looked old and was not comfortable .
i did not use the comforter and one of the layers .
there is also a _num_ inch ?
they did not offer me a chance to pay for it .
i never used the sauna , so i can not comment on that .
this is rather expensive as well .
this is not a bad place to live .
the shop is n't that great anyway .
such a shame .
it was made of wood .
the women at the front of the line had been waiting ten minutes .
finally , someone wandered in from the back and rang up our items .
i guess all customers are n't equal .
the high prices and poor treatment do n't add up .
i put up with the rude employees and dirty store because of this .
here is where my mistake happened .
sad , very , very sad .
not worth your money .
needless to say , this completely ruined my meal .
it tasted like milk and no coffee .
i was exceptionally disappointed .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her .
out of _num_ reviews , i 've written only _num_ _num_ star reviews .
that 's _num_ % .
if you hate the public , you should n't work with them .
she never even looked at me .
rude .
not hearing me , she goes , `` what was that ? ''
was she having a bad day ?
i dont know , i do n't care .
managed very poorly .
6am is too early for her . ''
seriously lady , you 're not a morning person .
my latte was n't bad ... was n't anything special either .
would n't come here again .
will probably never go here again because the person servicing me was rude .
they simply did n't care .
worst brazilian wax i have ever gotten .
she also used the same stick the entire time which is not sanitary .
eyebrow waxing is significantly overpriced at $ _num_ .
do not go here for waxing !
sorry that i did n't feel like waiting for three other customers .
i will likely not give them my business again .
my order was $ _num_ .
i got nowhere until i asked that a count of the register receipts .
that was not acceptable to me .
there is a bitter taste in my mouth about lotus grocery .
this is not giant eagle !
never shop at this asian grocery since many more open .
owner and employee alike no manners and nasty .
good store - rude owners and employees .
not anymore though .
not because of the food but the attitude of those cashiers .
so gross !
staff definitely are really rude .
try not to come here unless it 's for emergency .
the food you need to be careful , because sometimes they are expired .
also , parking is a big problem .
finally on tuesday , i came out to the shop at _num_ am sharp .
i tried on the dress and it was super short .
it was about _num_ inches off the ground !
other than that , it needed hemmed and taken out just a touch .
long story short - she took the dress in ... significantly ... by mistake .
there were no apologies for the mistakes .
we sat down and jim pulled out a list of what they had discussed .
i arrived and was disappointed to not see the arrangement i ordered .
imagine my frustration .
unsatisfied customer !
for $ _num_ plus delivery ?
will take my business elsewhere in the future .
no big deal , i would have been happy to help out .
i stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go .
when i received my order i immediately opened it to take a bite .
my biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste .
that 's right , my burrito had no flavor .
it was all beans and guacamole .
food was only just ok and service was even worse .
i 'm so disappointed in my experience at the carnegie library !
_num_ $ later , i tossed it and walked out , miserable .
this place is not _num_ stars .
i 'm too annoyed right now to make any funny comments .
it 's ... just ... not that good .
it all snapped into place for me one day recently .
that pissed me right off .
second , the rolls here are sloppy .
the beef was not the right color and was basically bland .
i would n't call this place authentic korean bbq .
just do n't expect fantastic korean bbq .
nice big restaurant , just lacking in overall experience .
this place was mediocre at best .
not impressed .
gross !
sad thing is , i 've been here a couple times .
so on to the sushi , oh yeah , it 's gross too !
the thing is the fish does not taste fresh at all !
but i 'd suggest you not !
you can not pay me money to eat here again .
they can not even cook edamame , it was undercooked and cold .
texture and temperature of the fish scared me .
save yourself pain and throw your money out the window .
first of all , foods were n't impressive .
they are too pricy as well .
their foods are not that tasteful .
in addition , one server working there was really rude and had bad attitude .
i do n't understand why he is working there .
he was so rude and ruined our friday night .
it 's really frustrating .
i wo n't come back this unpleasant and pricy restaurant never again .
absolutely the worst sushi my husband and i have ever had .
it was gross !
you could n't pay me to go back to this place !
upon arrival , the place is nearly empty .
however , it was also past lukewarm to the point of being cool .
the most disappointing part is the sushi itself .
the food that was delivered to us was simply inedible .
it had a huge hair in it , all wound around the crab .
totally disgusting .
they actually screwed up a green salad .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
total waste .
we will be calling again today to get our money back .
sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better .
there are much better sushi choices available .
i was there on a monday , so i just tried the sushi .
do n't bother with the sushi , ca n't speak to the korean bbq .
long story short : i ordered delivery .
vegetable roll was good , but not exceptional .
fried rice was ... just not what i expected , not exceptional either .
still , would not recommend .
pricey and does n't live up to it at all .
was the worst i have ever had .
will not go back .
i am sorry to say that this place still stinks .
that should have tipped me off .
i ordered the spicy chicken off of the lunch menu .
my food was terrible .
avoid this place at all costs !
fine , i had a sushi craving and could n't care less .
i ordered my spicy tuna and salmon rolls , both came within _num_ minutes .
but for the sushi - forget it .
that is simply lazy .
this place was awful .
her meal was so hot she could n't eat it .
mine was just disappointing .
the only thing i found good was the plain rice .
i also thought it was extremely over priced .
great service but the sashimi was bad .
never been here before .
disappointed in that .
what reason would a restaurant serve water in a plastic cup is beyond me .
i had a pretty negative experience for my first trip to sushi kim .
korean barbecue requires either the patron or the server to cook at the table .
i will give sushi kim another chance because i know others rave about it .
the wait staff -- not too pleasant !
man ... really bad from start to finish .
service is slow and horrible .
sushi is not flavorful at all .
the rice was some of the worst i have ever had .
i was definitely not wowed by the sushi here .
not bad but i have better in the strip .
so disappointed .
sadly , they just are n't .
could n't keep my eyes open !
another waste of time , wait until people my age get old .
i can guarantee you we will not be wasting our time in this theater .
avoid this crap hole at all costs .
the food is not that great .
my husband thought that the crab was bland and overcooked .
the menu is blah and the food is also .
awful service , overpriced food .
do n't waste your money !
on arrival , waitress seemed lost .
the wait staff is incompetent and the food is grossly overpriced with zero flavor .
i just paid the bill and we left and went to eat n park .
when we showed up , it was like i 'd never called .
the service here sucks .
it just sucks here .
it 's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer .
however , the service is seriously lacking .
the service has always been very slow .
go in summer or no point in going .
i 've went for _num_ years now waiting for it to become something good .
it 's not going to happen .
i ca n't begin to express my disappointment in your establishment .
the bartender gave my sandwich by mistake to another customer .
i waited .
ordered , is not .
the bill .
a little pricy for food but not too bad .
this is a poorly run business that could be turned into something great .
it was my anniversary tonight , a tuesday .
i was so excited to get all you can eat crab legs !
very disappointing .
however , the food and service is sub par .
not impressed .
_num_ minutes later half of our party needed to leave .
they went home hungry and very unhappy .
it 's not even summer yet .
i stopped by here this past thursday night with three others for dinner .
that was definitely not the case though .
mediocre at best .
buffalo shrimp $ _num_ you get _num_ , barely enough to share .
shrimp tacos were ok just on a basic bed of slaw for $ _num_ .
no drafts or specials on a friday when we got there at _num_ .
the river view from the deck was nice , but the smokers were not .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
_num_ stars .
my husband ordered the margarita pizza & i ordered the shrimp tacos with rice .
hubby did n't mind his , my was terrible ... horrendous .
rode my bike out to meet my old man .
but seriously , there are still restaurants that allow smoking ?
_num_ stars .
service was slow and inattentive all night .
described as having crab , lobster and shrimp .
seared ahi tuna sandwich - _num_ people in our group got this .
fish tacos - _num_ people in our party got these .
long story short , we wo n't be back .
overpriced beer and overpriced , bad food .
battered and fried .
we did n't care for the atmosphere and did n't actually eat anything .
in the running for one of the worst restaurants in pittsburgh .
looks great from the outside but everything else about it is terrible .
they turned no wait off and said they tried to call me .
the food sucked .
peel and eat shrimp were dry and tough , not fresh .
ordered crab cakes , they were dry and the crab tasted old as well .
will not be returning .
probably wo n't be back .
i 'd give this store negative stars if there was an option .
no one at the counter even acknowledged my arrival .
it looked rather like a barber shop .
the staff did n't look very professional either .
and after her comments , i 'm so glad that i decided to leave .
very poor service and atmosphere .
thumbs down !
at that point i would 've just taken a plain biscuit !
a complete lack of work ethic , it 's disgusting .
you do n't have to have people in the kitchen who act like that .
rotten food and over charging customer .
the crab cake sandwich is well prepared but from rotten crab .
a lunch over charged and wasted .
did n't go so well .
they then brought out two manicotti dinners which were fine .
who serves a drink without ice ?
we had no silverware , had to request it repeatedly .
our entrees , dessert and coffee all came out at different times .
the prime rib was fatty and cold .
the atmosphere is also drab and just depressing .
avoid !
the food is pretty bad for an italian restaurant .
i ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce .
the homemade bread was very sorry ... .
not worth the price .
the decor is very plain .
the food was underwhelming and pricey .
it 's just not that good .
the food could have come from a buffet and been better .
this place is just a flat out joke .
had no clue what i was talking about .
food was overpriced and less than average .
she had zero personality .
you 're probably thinking $ _num_ or $ _num_ , right ?
wrong !
now i really wish we would have .
i would have been furious if i paid $ _num_ for tasteless pasta .
never again will i go there .
the only reason i gave it a _num_ is because the steak was good .
otherwise , it would have been a _num_ or _num_ .
i 'm a guy , i 've got a short haircut .
nothing fancy -- short on the sides and back , an inch on top .
the top was n't even and was kind of a mess .
i wo n't be back .
fairly average italian food other than the meatballs .
too many good italian places in pittsburgh to choose here .
interior could use an update .
beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks .
the food quality does n't match the place at all .
i had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken !
zero stars .
the only good thing this restaurant has going for it , is their bar !
worst .
they said that each vegetable would be $ _num_ each .
with that said , i opted out of the calzone .
i ordered a steak and cheese hoagie and it arrived in a burnt bun .
i may try the pizza but other reviews noted it was pricy .
no refills , no checks on the food , nothing .
they do n't make whole pies and slice them up for individual slice orders .
the salon is so dirty we left before i let them cut me hair .
save your money , this place does n't deserve to be named ruth chris .
if this is the case then my oh my how the mighty have fallen .
sadly , however , they did not .
that does not make me chop liver .
however , my father and i shared the porterhouse for two .
for $ _num_ , i would have expected a much better piece of meat .
there were some pieces which could not be cut by my knife .
in addition , the presentation was poor .
i could have done better at home .
i 'm really torn by this review .
unfortunately , the worst part of my meal were the steaks .
next time i 'll try morton 's or capital grille .
but one is supposed to come here for steak .
extremely disappointing and appalling .
we were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable .
the corn chowder was ok but not very hot .
the steaks came and were both overcooked .
again , the food was mediocre but the staff was extremely friendly .
this was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them .
fail on all levels .
had to send steak back twice before i just said to hell with it .
horrible .
plus they have the worst presentation ever !
they clearly used too much oil and did not let the meat rest .
never going back !
how far we have fallen .
our bill was over $ _num_ .
tip was $ _num_ .
what a disappointment .
this is the `` service '' industry and you missed the mark tonight .
poor , slow service .
steak was over cooked and the plate was hot but not `` sizzling '' .
i said no , not yet which was probably a mistake .
our wine was not delivered until after our steaks arrived .
we will never return to a ruth 's chris steakhouse .
he gave them a quick polish and took $ _num_ off the price .
he had my money and had no more use for me .
this place is horrible .
you can get better service elsewhere for cheaper .
i brought my boots here to get fixed .
i wo n't be going here again .
no accessible stalls in restrooms .
not handicapped accessible .
wrong .
after i ordered , the waiter came back twice .
once to tell me that they could n't do the veggies .
oh , with _num_ pitiful shrimp on top .
there was the powder parmesan on the table which i added myself .
oh , but wait until i got my bill !
the shrimp were $ _num_ a piece .
what a rip off and so much for my budget .
we had a big group but my bill did n't have the tip added .
get me out of here !
i get that -- but the place was empty .
the place is empty .
it was such a nightmare .
i did n't know hamburgers were traditional italian fare .
the prices here can be ridiculous .
i mean , empty .
no one else in the same dining room .
i took the olive oil off the table next to ours .
so , i 've tried this place _num_ times and that was enough .
not worth the attitude of the staff .
it was just meh .
the chicken was n't very well seasoned and the sauce was overpowered by lemon .
all i could taste was citrus .
i also had a few bites of the chicken marsala .
i was really disappointed with this visit .
we probably wo n't be back any time soon .
negatives : the lighting , the decor and the smoking .
glad we went , but we wo n't go back .
so i left .
the selection here is stellar , but the prices are ridiculously high .
even whole foods is less expensive .
the service is most often rude .
the gelato counter was disappointing .
is n't that the same as `` not made fresh in pittsburgh ? ''
the truffles had two salted , one of which was milk chocolate .
they were so salty that the chocolate flavor did not come through .
however that is not what pittsburgh is about .
this is just my experience .
no thanks , much better candy shops around the city .
rude !
any way i could n't figure out what their problem was .
thank you for your horrible customer service i will never be back.
there 's nothing about this specific location that is bad .
inside is just average quality , equally average priced produce .
cheap , everyone seems to say that .
but i was n't feeling it here .
did n't even get a `` thanks '' with my change .
so not worth the walk that we took to get here .
we were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians .
the parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website .
the technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened .
the character of the place was great but could use a little tlc .
the menu was very small and hard to read and understand .
the ice cream technician could only take one order at a time .
i ordered mine , chocolate , and cried vanilla .
she did n't listen at all .
i figured palace like this would have made their own strawberry topping .
_num_ sundaes were $ _num_ .
literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact .
too bad .
no breaking of the ice .
this place is terrible !
ugh .
skip it !
really disappointed !
she left her other co-worker to handle the entire crowd .
we had the same experience when we walked in .
however i agree with the previous reviews that the staff are killing it .
just kind of awkward , but no big deal .
a regular ice cream cone was $ _num_ .
tasty , but not real butter pecan .
i gave her a call and she did n't pick up .
at this point i really had to use the restroom .
i waited until _num_ and knocked normally so that it would be heard .
i 'd give it zero stars if i could .
worst customer service !
but these corporate suits refused .
so - they 've lost a customer - a platinum customer .
a little goodwill would have cost them nothing .
truly pathetic .
when i checked in , the front desk staff was missing .
when i checked out , the front desk staff was missing .
the pillows were appalling and there was no complimentary breakfast and no refrigerator .
what a disgrace to the marriott name .
ok , but they do not go out of their way to help !
finally they allowed me to put down cash .
literally worst service i 've ever received at a hotel .
do not stay here .
you will be disappointed .
the manager nowhere to be seen .
no upgrades .
not personal at all strictly business .
the better restaurant is the little cafe across the street owned by same owner .
to get a cab walk to the westin across the street .
no hello on entering .
not friendly .
not a _num_ star .
really a _num_ star .
nothing to recommend .
do n't walk away .
not even the shuttle goes anywhere useful .
linda b august _num_ will never stay again !
i had a bad impression of this hotel before i even entered .
eventually , i had to get my project manager to resolve this issue .
do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 am .
that young lady obliged with no hesitation - i was very grateful .
the desk ) until i 've given the room the all clear .
i could n't have been happier !
no bueno and no thank you !
my second room : same line , 3rd floor , also accessible .
that 's unacceptable .
shower shoes , i never leave home without them !
i reserved a king room and got stuck in a room with two queens .
i will not be staying at this location again .
they apologized which i appreciate , but it does n't fix anything .
i ca n't wait to check out .
her corned beef was brown and bad .
the real reason for the single star was the cole slaw .
it was off .
yuck i have avoided this subway like the plague .
i literally walk past this subway _num_ times a week .
the attitude of the workers here is just pitiful .
what a wreck .
rude customer service .
my gripe here is that i ended up with scratches on my wheels .
waiting _num_ minutes for a cold club and cup of soup is totally unacceptable .
it was not crowded , but the waiter was almost useless .
plus i was served teriyaki fajitas .
overall it was just ok food served by an incompetent waiter .
for me the food was terrible .
i would n't even have cooked this way for an enemy .
they are in terrible shape .
i could n't believe it !
well , this place manages to be worse than it .
the place is rather run down .
the buffet was really terrible .
it just was n't a great environment .
_num_ stars .
soups were borderline offensive .
there probably wo n't be a wait !
bad !
worst chinese food in pittsburgh !
this is the worst chinese food i 've had .
and pittsburgh has some pretty bad chinese places .
the golden palace buffet is bad , but at least edible .
it was late at night near closing , only thing i could find open .
went to _num_ tavern for lunch a few weeks back .
second i was with a party of _num_ that all ordered salads .
overcooked and cold .
the salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap .
the place was empty .
it 's the same thing but _num_ more dollars .
they did have other types of dogs but they were more expensive .
it was bad in every way it could be bad .
frozen , greasy , tasteless , heavy on bland batter and light on fish .
so why do they get _num_ stars instead of just _num_ ?
but each time i come away disappointed , even more than last time .
every time , the hotdogs ( and brats ) are harder than a rock .
wo n't be eating there again .
i do n't understand why this place think 's it has famous corned beef .
i can only believe it 's because there are no other deli 's downtown .
the corned beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special .
not worth the trip .
i do n't think sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich .
meat was dry under seasoned and luke warm .
the bread was just sliced supermarket bread .
rules made by men .
when the food finally came it was bad .
the prices are cheap , but it 's not worth it .
the food itself was not too bad .
not my favorite .
my friend 's greek salad however was very tasty .
a place i would go back to but not regularly .
the food was terrible !
we quickly found out why .
i would not recommend this place for food .
this is a very small irish pub .
the bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable .
are you gon na eat that ?
if not , um , why would we want to pay for it ?
terrible .
they did n't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy .
the soda was flat .
possible the worst restaurant i was ever in .
worst experience at a restaurant ever .
i do n't need anything fancy but this was pathetic .
why did n't we just leave then .
if i could rate this a zero , i would .
food was not awful , but just barely average .
worst restaurant ever .
finally got seated and waited _num_ minutes for waters and then ate mediocre food .
wo n't be back .
the steak was rough and bad .
i will never be back .
i have better food in m own .
definitely has the local irish bar feel to it .
mine was not very cold and his pour was light .
$ _num_ credit card minimum .
no bathrooms .
it really feels like a total lack of effort , honesty and professionalism .
this represents a real problem for the city .
this place was horrible .
the walls were dirty , nasty and dingy .
it smelled awful inside .
it was quite crowded .
and i just did not like my surroundings .
not a good way to sell the city ... horrible !
this continued for the total of _num_ hours .
there is no wifi and only two outlets .
it would have probably been better to take the mega bus .
not good at all .
thus station needs more amenities and a makeover to compete with the dc one !
the `` chicken '' is dark , fatty , and inedible .
do n't miss the _num_ pound tub of msg as you walk in .
you should skip this place for sure .
the place was more of a hole in the wall then i can appreciate .
cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality .
the food was gross and i usually would n't say that about a place .
never going back .
it 's not worth it .
they were very quick ( food ordered and delivered in under _num_ minutes ) .
the noodles were very bland and almost chewy .
my boyfriend 's general tso 's was less than subpar .
the egg roll 's did n't even have shrimp in them .
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had .
it was horrible .
the fried rice did n't have any vegetable in it and was so bland .
the egg roll wasnt even cooked and the cabbage was awful .
i called to complain and they hung up on me .
do n't waste your time , order from somewhere else .
worst chinese i 've had in pittsburgh .
i spend _num_ dollars on soggy food that lacked flavor .
cheap food but my chicken was burnt .
my co-worker 's chicken was n't cooked right .
not gon na order from here again .
we wasted $ _num_ on spoiled food .
do not use this dry cleaner .
there are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around .
they lost my clothes and charged me for stuff i never sent .
ehh ... it 's not all that .
watch the dried bulk stuff - it 's old and stale .
i found little bugs crawling around the seeds and nuts in my little bags .
bought the store 's speciality sausages - bland and tasted of spoiled meat .
cold cuts were good though pricey .
highly questionable hygiene for a food store !
disgusting .
i will not go back until they clean up the place .
that was not the first time .
i have a idea , get rid of those cashiers , fire them !
i will not go back until they are gone .
a simple yes or no would have been nice .
in a very rude voice .
needless to say i walked away .
obviously she hates her job , then get another one !
every january i buy _num_ months worth of cheese for my family members .
i proceeded to say , '' are you laughing at me ? ''
altogether , spent $ _num_ and left with a great disappointment !
extremely poor service .
this is the last time i try this unclean and rude establishment .
breeze and the cat was tested and was negative .
there was no internet at the time .
i would not bring a spider there .
if i could give this place _num_ starts i would .
it was just average , nothing special .
this is no mike and tony 's or big greek gyro in market square .
i wo n't be back .
the workers are not greek chefs and are very condescending .
the gyro sandwich for $ _num_ was ok at best .
they threw some tomatoes on it .
the fries for $ _num_ were undercooked .
we are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup .
they charge about $ _num_ for a drink with no free refills .
tables were not very clean .
disappointing experience after almost a year since the last time i was here .
ingredients were n't fresh and the gyro was heavy on the spices .
ordered a gyro and the meat was cold .
not acceptable .
i really do n't see the hype .
i 've only eaten here once before .
i 've included this very depressing looking `` steak hoagie '' .
the food was terrible & the cooks need to get it together .
just order from one of the two sites i listed above .
not one employee even said hello !
i walked out !
, the service was fine , but the food was totally forgettable .
i remember the waiters attitude more then some of the food .
the menu is n't particularly veg friendly , but it 's not too bad .
lidia 's does high-end traditional italian without being too pretentious or too predictable .
i really wanted to like this place , but i really did n't .
long story short , we passed on dessert .
i wo n't go back .
lidia 's is an upscale olive garden with slightly better wine list .
the biggest problem ?
everything is bland .
they have a salt problem .
the lamb chops were awful .
lamb tasted like the grill and not at all like lamb .
the tomato was hard as rock .
just bad .
bread is awful .
just in the way it is laid out and with the choices .
but the worse is the pasta trio .
the concept is just so olive garden .
i just have to wonder why lidia would create a menu like this .
it just does n't match her books or shows at all .
it does nothing to support the brand of lidia .
unless she is really trying to take over the olive garden market .
their menu does n't include really any .
maybe those light fixtures would have tasted better than the lasagna ?
the service was not very good .
we left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food .
not so much .
i had a bite of a chocolate torte , and was very impressed .
all things told , though , i would spend my money elsewhere .
it was not spicy .
it was overcooked , like rubber , and served on plain white beans .
i wo n't go back .
most of his seafood was also overcooked and tasteless .
i was very disappointed with my meal here .
and was really disappointed .
too bad the food was n't good .
the beet salad was underwhelming .
my other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy .
another disappointment .
and thus my rating of meh .
which is a huge shame .
this place had horrible service .
i was horrible .
we were eating here often , but it got boring quickly .
soooo disappointing !
i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes .
then , i ate here .
are these the same people running this restaurant ?
do n't you care about your reputation and good name ?
guess not .
also , the service was not that good .
too bad .
one word ; gross .
this is not italian food - it 's pittsburgh italian food .
the wine list is lacking .
in short , avoid this place !
the main courses themselves were a disaster .
and the manicotti was watery and flavorless .
i ordered the chicken marsala ( waitress 's favorite ) and it was disgusting .
lidia 's was a major disappointment for me .
decor and service were just fine , no issues there .
i was disappointed in the food !
i get better shrimp pasta at macaroni grill !
i 'm not sure why people like this place so much .
the service was friendly but the food was very poor .
i would not entertain having an event for any more than _num_ people .
what an embarrassment .
the lasagne i ordered was flavorless as well .
for salad , they only served `` caesar salad '' .
overall , let me say that the restaurant is becoming dated .
colors and decor seem boring and out of style .
the service was horrible .
from hostess crew to the bar to the waitress , it was bad .
rude .
did i mention the service was bad ?
the bar staff was n't concerned with us and were n't friendly at all .
then it took another _num_ to order .
then _num_ mins to get our food !
however , seconds never came .
waitress did n't even know until i told her politely .
however she charged the $ _num_ pasta trio ( which comes with desert ) .
now i had a $ _num_ salad and $ _num_ pasta trio .
i was expecting $ _num_ + $ _num_ salad upgrade .
ugh .
is n't the rule `` customer is always right '' ?
finally , we felt like the whole restaurant clientele has declined .
avoid !
what a disappointment .
we were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful .
there was no background music .
the waiter was young and inexperienced .
would not recommend it .
this spot would n't have lasted a year in nyc .
i ate here when it opened , a and again _num_ years later .
nothing has changed .
for starters we were served ice cold meatballs and limp soggy salads .
the entrees were dull and lacked seasoning .
it 's tough to find anything good here .
the menu offerings were spotty .
gnocchi and duck ragu was what i ordered .
i was very disappointed .
ate at this resturant while on a business trip .
our food was just average , nothing special .
the service was absolutely horrible .
our waitress carrie was extremely rude and had a really bad attitude .
i would probably not come back .
lidia 's was one of our favorite italian restaurant in the city .
first , our waitress was not well informed of the offerings that evening .
she had to check with kitchen several times to answer our questions .
second , our food was served just barley warm .
third , the food was lacking in proper seasoning and without any taste .
i guess i expected fabulous -- but everything was just good , nothing spectacular .
we will not be back .
nothing to talk about .
the service was sub-par on a friday night .
for my entree , i tried the lasagna recommended by the waiter .
took my friends from out of town to lidia last night , very disappointed .
i could n't understand why people raving about it too much .
over charge and terrible food .
terrible will never go back .
calamari was not fresh .
pasta trio had the worst sauce i have ever tasted .
caesar salad was drowning in tart dressing .
pasta trio - _num_ out of the _num_ was passable .
good groupon deal but terrible food - will not be back .
horrible .
i do n't remember it being this bad .
pasta trio was bizarre .
only passable pasta was the pear & ricotta ravioli .
waitress walked away two times while opening our bottle of wine .
it was downhill from there .
lamb chops and shrimp pasta were just ok.
( $ _num_ + $ _num_ ) .
the salads came out and the plates were a little sloppy in appearance .
for the main course , i selected the gnocchi and grilled sausage .
the sausage was made in-house and was very flavorful .
very unappetizing and i was unable to continue eating .
the pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was n't too sweet .
even the server commented on the lack of a sauce .
no meat in any of the _num_ pastas .
not very tasty .
not same price .
i had the pasta trio .
none of the pastas had any flavor .
the caesar salad was fine , but not inspiring .
the three pastas were very , very basic .
the only thing that saved the evening from disaster were our server and busser .
i think lidia & grandma would be appalled !
so i was appalled by a lousy not fresh dirty salad !
i pushed it away ugh !
do n't be fooled !
it came w duck ragu that was ice cold !
try their calamari over angel hair yum !
lidia should be embarrassed .
grilled octopus : where 's the octopus ?
waitress was nice but it 's obvious that this place is run poorly .
staff training is badly needed .
what a huge disappointment .
bottom line : horrid service , mediocre food .
no wine glasses or anything to make the table look pretty .
our server was nice but rushed .
there was absolutely no care or thought put into this salad .
my date 's bruschetta appetizer was bland .
i was presented with ... an empty plate .
which i really did n't since they were all mediocre with little flavor .
in the meantime , date was unimpressed with the chicken .
if possible , the service got worse after we talked to him .
and when the dessert came it was ice cold and solid as a rock .
horrible service and food was bland .
lidia should spend more time in her restaurants to see first hand .
the waiter said she only comes to town twice a year .
your brand is being damaged because your staff does n't seem to care .
very disappointed .
most likely will not return .
more disappointing than the service was the food , which was really underwhelming .
granted , the calamari and shrimp that were there were cooked perfectly .
risotto , while one of my favorites , is n't pasta .
it has been nothing but bad service .
i give a _num_ rating only because of the service .
there are fruit flies hovering around our table too .
the pasta with chicken was about the best from the trio .
it 's an ayce trio .
it 's now 8:30 and still not even close to dessert .
i 'm sure the ending does n't get much better .
we were ... disappointed .
our main dishes were equally mediocre .
the wild boar ravioli tasted fine , but the presentation was seriously lacking .
the duck breast was under done .
so disappointing ... .
he never approached our table , but he walked past us several times .
we continued to wait another _num_ minutes then decided to leave .
lidia should be ashamed that this is being run this way .
really wanted to like it here , but am never going back .
for a professional chef 's restaurant the `` pasta '' was mediocre .
fake italian at its finest .
unless olive garden is closed , do n't go here .
unfortunately yelp asked to provide more details on review .
the information for this restaurant needs to be updated !
last week my husband and i visited pittsburgh for a rock concert .
it was a very disappointing meal .
i ordered the pasta trio , and my husband ordered the risotto .
not exciting .
it was pasta , after all , one small serving of each .
i had dessert , which was _num_ flavors of gelato .
sorry to say , restaurant is riding on its former reputation .
the bartender does n't belong in the business .
rude to patron and to his own colleagues .
a turn off .
first off , it is desperately in need of some updates .
and service is piss poor and understaffed .
_num_ big screen tvs .
well sports rock failed on all accounts .
i was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual tvs on each table .
plus , beer was _num_ !
prices too high for strip district beer .
upstairs looks like it 's a club at night .
it is a white pizza with minimal ingredients except for the lamb skewers .
standard so-so pittsburgh pizza .
if they did n't , that would be fine we 'd call someplace else .
should be _num_ minutes '' .
_num_ minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he 's on his way .
_num_ minutes later he calls again and asks where we are .
when we finally got the pizza , it was not hot .
better luck next time .
after ordering from here my credit card number was stolen .
ordered two personal size pizzas , spicy fries , fried zucchini & onion rings .
tastes plain & over cooked .
i do n't think i 'm being harsh .
is sad because the pizza is great but the service is horrible !
delivery : horrible experience .
we waited over _num_ hours for the food to be delivered .
she promptly explained that the internet was down .
and , apparently , delivery .
it was all kind of meh to me .
food is terrible so is customer service .
there are better restaurants in pittsburgh .
this is piss poor excuse for a turkish restaurant .
this was more than _num_ hours after i had placed the order .
as soon as i hung up the phone , the food was delivered .
i did not receive the free cheesy bread and the drink order was incorrect .
i would be careful ordering food here .
the service was very poor .
delivery was fine but the food was terrible .
disappointed !
unacceptable .
but it was seriously bad .
but i could n't eat it .
are you kidding me ?
these hoagies are the most pathetic hoagies i 've ever seen or eaten !
you should be embarrassed and ashamed to even be selling these !
horrible !
we checked in , put our stuff in our room , and left .
later on , we realized that there was no soap anywhere in the bathroom .
you 're paying like $ _num_ a night for no soap .
about _num_ minutes later someone came with soap .
it was a super rude way of dealing with that situation .
the next morning we tried to leave and it was nearly impossible .
the whole experience was absolutely ridiculous .
but would it kill you to spend a little to upgrade your rooms ?
upon entering it smelled of sewage and was very dark .
it did seem a little unwelcoming and a little dated .
i was then transferred to housekeeping where i was constantly sent to a voicemail .
it is unfortunate because that blanket has been in the family for _num_ years .
i was tired , packed bags , and waiting to get to the airport .
i did n't hear back .
they said yes , and i just confirmed it had not been .
by far , the worst hotel staff experience i have ever had .
i would never stay in this hotel again .
the cleanliness of the bathrooms is less than desirable .
the pittsburgh auto show was held at the david l. convention center .
we lucked out and go on the shuttle over without waiting in the cold .
it was terrible waiting in line , but it moved quickly .
it was $ _num_ a piece for my wife and i to get in .
children _num_ and under are free .
$ _num_ for _num_ items is crazy !
domestic beers were $ _num_ .
i mean thats absurd to charge these prices !
the auto show was a disappointment .
that was frustrating !
it was pretty busy and there were people everywhere .
it was annoying fighting the crowds to look at the certain cars .
all in all , it was a disappointment this year .
we might not go every year , but maybe every other year .
the check-in desk was super slow during my stay there .
still , i think there are newer hotels that provide the same .
we got this hotel room via hotwire at a great price .
parking at the hotel is expensive .
my biggest complaint is that our shower was n't clean .
the coffee shop attached to the hotel is just ok .
or it had just spilled and they did n't want to waste it .
however , the customer service lacks excellence and the wifi is completely unreliable .
completely worthless wifi .
we have stayed in westin hotels all over the country .
but this place is downright disgusting .
no fitted sheets on the beds ?
the tv movies did n't work ?
the place is just dirty .
two seconds later , they come to want to clean ?
i would n't step foot in that hot tub ever again .
unless you want to catch a disease .
so gross .
the pool is strictly a lap pool .
and the women 's locker room was nasty .
looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month .
the only plus was the shuttle service and driver .
do n't stay here , save your money .
however , i had the absolute worst hotel experience at the pittsburgh westin .
the terrible experience happened before i even arrived .
i ordered the turkey blt with lemon aioli and arugula salad .
really poor service and way overpriced .
the rooms are not worth the money .
the wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good .
i would not revisit the westin convention center .
had to have my sheets changed when i got to my room .
worst elevator system i 've ever come across .
rude front desk staff .
talk about a nasty look and attitude .
i was sooooo disappointed with this hotel .
the ac barely works .
_num_ stars .
but maybe they 're not even trying !
again this is pittsburgh not philly , dc , or ny .
breakfast options in the immediate area are almost nonexistent .
the coffee maker is disgusting and smells .
i gave the management a heads up , and it was not fixed .
disappointing at every turn .
this hotel does not live up to the westin standards i 'm used too .
the hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all .
the beer is cheap .
horrible , go to long john silver 's .
i hear oyster bar and think delicious raw oysters not deep fried crap .
i should know better than to have high expectations .
the two jumbo fried shrimp were ok.
nothing but breading .
ugh .
both the waitress and the bartender were extremely rude .
i was n't impressed with my clam chowder .
however , they have several cooked selections .
i should have known then that it would be a bad experience .
waitress wiped off table and pushed crumbs into my lap .
styrofoam plates and plastic forks .
it really is just a bar with bad bar food .
cash only is really customer friendly as well .
do n't understand how anyone could give this place a favorable rating .
i 've had the fried oysters before , and they were pretty good .
this lunch kinda sucked .
a native all my life and never been , finally went last summer .
why it 's locked i do n't know .
totally gross !
sadly this one did n't do that for me .
this restaurant is horrible .
the waitress was rude and tried to rush us .
the only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind .
i found this restaurant online and in my hotel room magazine .
sadly we were disappointed with our meal .
we were in an area with a server , but the service was terrible .
i 've never seen it somewhere stating they only take cash .
are u kidding me ?
i am disappointed .
the food was ok but it 's not memorable .
imitation crab & lots of filling .
so i do n't need to tell you how nasty that was .
my house made chips were good & cole slaw had very little flavor .
so i was like dang !
my return is questionable .
first thing they said to us was , we only accept cash .
guess what , no fresh oysters .
the beer was cold and that is the only reason they got one star .
i was embarrassed because he was my guest and it was my idea .
if a cold beer is all you want , go for it .
this place is a pittsburgh legend u got ta stop in .
the oysters are also old , as in not fresh .
just checked it out for the first time .
kind of disappointed but it was five dollars for the shrimp basket i got .
the shrimp does n't have any flavor and just tastes like grease .
i was the girl who came in tonight , alone , around 8pm !
_num_ minutes later , nothing .
eventually i had enough and left , which they still probably did n't notice .
avoid at all costs !
i do not recommend this restaurant .
the fish sandwich is bland on a generic bun .
the soup was nothing to write home about .
the fries were generic .
long wait time for initial service and drink refills .
just not what i had in mind .
i wo n't be going back .
when the oysters came out , they did n't even look like oysters .
they were very flat ... thinner than your typical frozen chicken nugget .
not much oyster taste , just the taste of the breading .
this was some of the worst pizza i 've ever had .
this does n't generally happen to me .
i could n't eat anymore .
avoid .
this place is awful .
they screwed up my order and refused to fix it .
its really too bad , they are super close to my apartment .
i 'm upset and offended .
but the place was disgusting and the cashier was incredibly rude .
had the gyro and added feta .
bottle of coke had icy slush in it .
update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best .
possibly the worst pizza i have ever eaten .
this would n't even qualify as pizza in north jersey .
zero stars .
female manager on duty asked for $ _num_ in exchange for a pizza .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the eastern european girl at the register is awful .
she should probably get fired .
the pizza at this place is o.k .
last night i decided to give it another try and got crappy mozzarella sticks .
the meat in the steak sandwich was like dog food .
it gets packed .
i 'd never had the food before .
so gross .
i usually get the steak salad which used to be good .
the last _num_ times getting it , i have had issues .
i gave the bartender $ _num_ and only received $ _num_ back .
i can not eat this .
sticky floors , bad smell , just general lack of housekeeping .
not sure why people like it so much .
if we had been drinking we would n't care .
maybe they had a bad day .
one other person tried it and would not eat it .
the fish n chips were not good .
the fries were soggy and soft , fish mediocre .
very disappointed .
will not go eat there again !
there 's a reason why this place has no reviews .
it 's never open ... not even at 6:30 pm on a thursday .
i guess i was supposed to know that it was closed .
needless to say , i probably wo n't be back .
this is a very odd restaurant .
i was here once and probably wo n't be back .
you can definitely get better vietnamese elsewhere in the city .
she could n't believe that i said that .
i feel like she treated me like a criminal .
the service as mentioned was poor .
this place does decent thai food , but is nothing special .
this was the single worst thai meal i have ever had in my life .
this proved to have been a massive error in judgement on all our parts .
the first thing i ordered was a bowl of lemongrass soup .
gross .
we will not be back .
was just rude .
the wonton soup was horrible .
when i walked in the place was empty .
first thing i noticed is the place was an absolute sauna .
she shrugged and did not seem interested .
i ordered the lemon grass soup with shrimp and the papaya salad .
i would not order this again .
water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty .
the pad thai was bland and generic , and tasted almost gummy .
and i would n't have minded if the food had been amazing .
but sadly , it was n't .
we were seated immediately because it was n't too crowded ( bad sign ) .
did they think they could get away with it and we would n't notice ?
but then i got my chicken lemongrass soup .
it was so tiny and there was hardly any chicken in it .
waiter was awful and food ( pad thai ) was not much better .
this is by far the worst thai restaurant i 've ever been to .
the servers are rude and slow , and the food is awful .
just had the panang tofu for lunch , and was crazy underwhelmed .
this trip was bad , even for the price .
there was no sorry , we 're working on it ... etc .
no explanation at all was given .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
terrible terrible customer service .
poor service , awful attitudes and sub-par food .
thai tea was no bueno .
i 'll probably not be back .
there was just one table of _num_ seated and eating when i arrived .
and , a table of _num_ leaving and all paying separately .
all that said , the huge table of _num_ had left .
but , no such luck .
the food came out quickly enough .
but it was quite underwhelming .
i settled with the thai fried rice with beef .
there was a ton of thai basil in the dish which was quite overwhelming .
i chose the hot and sour soup .
the soup was neither hot in temperature or spice but it certainly was sour .
however , last night 's dinner was just plain bad .
it was also virtually tasteless .
the food is bland , bland bland .
the inside of the resturant is cramped and poorly maintained .
i decided to play it safe and ordered the broccoli in garlic sauce .
do n't waste your time or money .
rude service , and pizza was subpar .
na ... wo n't be back !
random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .
just awful .
it really is pure torture sometimes .
ugh .
but no biggie - we agree to split into different tables .
ridiculous , especially if they were expecting us to be there .
an extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and i .
also the pizza was bad .
way overpriced and service was n't great .
i only gave them _num_ stars because the pizza itself was pretty good .
i ca n't imagine anyone liking this super bland cardboard !
i just do n't get how anyone could like it ?
no taste at all .
both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy .
no sauce much and cheap cheese .
somewhat generic , but the espresso gets the job done .
it was quite small though .
average pittsburgh pizza and fried stuff pile , nothing special though .
fried items arrive a little on the cold and soggy side .
you know , standard italian hoagie .
i substituted steamed rice for the fried rice .
it was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice .
i could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross .
hope i have better luck next time !
i just ate half of a cockroach .
gross .
the food was unremarkable .
every time i have been to cafe sam i have been very disappointed .
avoid this place .
got ta say , i 'm not a fan of this place .
confusing , and a pain .
but over the years it has gone down hill .
i wo n't go back .
my girlfriend had a similarly bland meal .
down the street is a better option - wish they were open for lunch .
under no circumstances would i eat here again .
but oh , how the standards have fallen !
looking back , i am glad it happened that way .
items seem overcooked or undercooked .
this was probably the worst plain cake donut i 've ever had .
it was dry , not at all crispy , and had no flavor .
i could n't even finish it .
i did n't find it to be anything special .
i am positive this bakery used to be better ... something has changed there .
it should have been a clue when they were soggy .
after my most recent experience , however , i will never be coming back .
she refused , and again tried to place the blame on me .
and sure enough , cue tuesday -- no call .
she failed to follow-up when she promised .
did i mention the cake was dry ?
i ordered a long john which looked pretty good .
unfortunately it was n't .
i ate maybe a bite or two before offering it to a coworker .
so many great bakeries in pittsburgh so i would not go back .
she showed me two options and i chose one .
it was also very dry .
they said they had an appointment to taste wedding cakes .
it all comes down to the crust -- i threw it out .
i had small cheese steak sub - asking only for mayo and lettuce .
but no .
mixed in with this were some dried herbs - maybe an italian mix ?
all i could taste was the overwhelming chemical , fake garlic flavor .
i mean thin like salad dressing , runny , thin .
this stuff tasted like really cheap , bad , ranch dressing .
while we are talking about the meat - why use this garbage ?
i am paying almost _num_ bucks for this sub .
well , this too was a massive disappointment .
yes , bland .
bad sauce with flavorless cheese .
yes , more for the garbage .
we ended up throwing out about _num_ % of what we paid for .
they just lost a loyal customer ... never again .
ordered _num_ cuts to eat in and _num_ and a hoagie to go ... .
they get _num_ star because less was not an option .
so i ordered _num_ for myself and my gf .
i get there and the total is over $ _num_ !
two and a half dollars more is not a little .
wrong again !
swimming i tell you swimming in grease !
and that its all the owners fault about the price .
poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership .
the crust was not like usual and to much sauce .
i used to love this place , but the service is horrible now .
if you want something delivered you have to wait about _num_ hours .
our food is always wrong .
will not be coming back .
bad service !
it was all i could do not to make a scene .
fuck that i do n't need to be disrespected like that .
they use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza .
also , the toppings were not greatly blended , just rather sprinkled .
did n't even enjoy the pizza crust .
avoid at all costs .
reviews but they let me down .
the barber could not even cut a straight fade .
i ordered here after the many good reviews but was quite disappointed .
the pizza was n't terrible but it certainly was n't good in my opinion .
zero flavor and the mushrooms were canned .
i am disappointed .
so it was no discount at all .
i can not review the food .
i did not get a chance to eat there .
all the white people get to eat , we do not ?
the woman who answered the phone said yes to both so i rushed over .
assuming this was due to the discount , i did n't complain .
receive my check to find out it was all full price .
she admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake .
i do n't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous .
a subpar meal and subpar service in addition to false marketing .
completely ridiculous .
terrible .
this was flat , one note .
yep , this place is terrible .
_num_ star average ?
update : _num_ hours later and still feel sick from this meal .
ugh .
mediocre at best .
the flavor in the tiki masala was so bland .
worst delivery service .
they both looked old and one of them smelled old .
both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well .
i sadly had to throw most of it away .
i did n't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala !
i can easily say this is the worst indian food i have ever eaten .
maybe i went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible .
but the noodles are a disgrace .
no way , dudes .
go down the street and get some tastier food at tram 's kitchen .
i 'm not joking about the water .
pho broth takes like nine hours to make .
in fact i was quite disappointed .
based on all the other reviews , probably safe to stick to pho .
if you have an emergency , go to the vca castle shannon animal hospital .
for everything else , try the cat clinic .
i asked about late hours but the latest appointment is at _num_ pm .
i start work at _num_ am .
i do n't need to receive attitude from a receptionist .
clearly , they do n't need my business .
i felt like i spent $ _num_ for absolutely nothing .
i think i 'll be going elsewhere next time .
it was a mess .
an expensive mess .
i stop in every week for it .
last week , i got a large and went back for more .
but , lately it 's been hit or miss .
it is all watered down and gross .
if your not a chain smoker , opt for takeout .
the bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky .
the only good thing is that the drinks are cheap .
but i really would n't recommend going there .
he obviously did n't care at all .
i called restaurant.com for a refund , and told them what he said .
i did n't get a chance to try any food and i never will .
this place is terrible .
tandoori chicken does n't taste like one etc .
decor is tasteless and old .
carpet looks really dirty .
i 'm definitely not coming back .
seem nice but the food is not that good .
no flavor .
we also had a masala and that too was not great .
this was not nearly as good .
very disappointing .
went there with friends for the first time and felt quite disappointed .
food was dry and the sauces were watery .
i do n't know why all the hype on this place .
trust me , you 'll be glad you did .
sadly , i was disappointed .
the karaoke host was just lame .
and he had a cd setup -- seriously , cds , in _num_ .
it was just really lackluster in my opinion .
the karaoke had a very limited selection .
wo n't be going back .
i do n't understand why people love this place .
the bar food is typical .
if you want no frills beer and bar food , they are no frills .
the place smells awful and the workers are grumpy .
no thanks .
there are other italian grocery stores close by .
i rushed to tan today after work .
atmosphere was bad .
i 'm weird like that .
it 's just generic stuff .
like i said , olive garden , only local .
so i would n't go back .
it 's not my kind of food , or place .
the other day someone asked me ... where 's your favourite vietnamese food ?
i do n't even care about the decor or seating etc .
it looked a mess .
honestly , it looked like someone had already starting eating this .
but as i ate , i was even more disappointed .
they hardly put any fresh vegetables in it , and the vermicelli is overcooked .
the spring rolls were completely soggy .
i do n't think their menu is limited though , it seemed fairly typical .
my boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl .
however , my dish was nothing to brag about .
it did n't taste bad by any means , but not restaurant quality .
my boyfriend 's dinner was a real disappointment , however .
it almost looked like boiled ground beef .
i do n't understand this either .
the rolls were extremely bland and chewy .
the sauce that was served with it did n't do much to save it .
the beef pho was sub par .
also : $ _num_ for pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing .
for starters , the portion of the pho is extremely skimpy !
seriously , would it kill you to add more rice noodles ?
let me tell you , this place is a big let down .
i do n't know why people are giving it such rave reviews .
the portions are tiny , and the pho broth leaves you unsatisfied .
it lacks the true flavor that pho broth should have .
i quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in _num_ bites .
it took forever for the food to arrive , it was a big bowl .
so highly disappointed with my pho experience .
the restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant .
the menu is small with very limited choices .
then we had _num_ different kind of pho for our main entree .
there was also excessive msg in the soup dishes .
the food is cheap .
this is something that tram 's has gotten badly wrong every time i visited .
personally , i do n't see what is so special about it .
they 're big , but again nothing special .
at tram 's , the pho bowl is small .
the taste is reminiscent of pho but is n't quite right .
this was n't it .
it was dark and crowded ( and a little bit dingy ) .
bad service , bland food .
do n't believe the hype .
i think i chose wrong .
ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable .
another sour note , they dropped off some spring rolls at our table .
later on , we saw them on our bill .
they were overpriced , and not worth it .
tram 's kitchen in my opinion is not really worth it .
the food was mediocre and full of msg .
the pho was nothing special and place was small and looks dirty .
my total bill does n't reflect the price of the dishes i ordered .
my bill came out to be higher than what 's listed on the menu .
the service was okay , they were really nice and never rude .
the portions were really small .
i gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times .
either way , i do n't understand the hype surrounding this place .
the color of the dish was as bland as the taste .
as for the atmosphere , not a big deal for me .
if that 's not enough to stop you , read on .
bland and disappointing , the pho most of all .
the dish was dry and lacked flavor .
as it were , i was n't impressed .
on top of that , my meatballs were quite dry , even in soup .
the service , was not the best .
very disappointed !
pho is ok , not bad .
this is the worst .
i will never try it again .
maybe i 'm spoiled with good vietnamese food but this was terrible .
also questionable tofu in the vegetarian spring rolls .
i 'm vietnamese , worse viet food ever !
maybe i just did n't order the right dish .
i ordered the beef vermicelli bowl , one egg roll , one spring roll .
my husband and i stayed in pittsburgh for weeks and wanted to have pho .
i read about good stuff here but was very disappointed .
we have had vietnamese food in other states before but here is the worst .
soup has no flavour and it seems to have excessive msg .
egg roll and fried rice is too greasy .
service is not friendly .
turns out this was n't the case .
wrong .
the entire restaurant could use a thorough cleaning .
i left , and do n't intend to return .
try tom 's diner or eat 'n park instead .
heck , go to a grocery store instead .
the food is n't something to rave about but it 's edible .
never a dull moment .
finding a good ol ' diner in pittsburgh is n't exactly easy .
the restaurant has the diner feel , no doubt .
you ca n't mess it up ) .
the food ranges from mediocre to bland .
worst food in pittsburgh .
i think the food is boring .
wrong !
_num_ but i rounded down .
i do n't want to be too mean .
had no desire to eat throughout the day .
this was some of the worst food i 've ever had .
the two times i 've been there i was unhappy .
cheap , average diner food .
ummm , we 're pretty sure my boyfriend got food poisoning here .
it 's disgusting .
the food is crap .
they screwed up a club sandwich & fries .
kind of gross if you ask me .
food can be pretty good , service can be pretty bad .
so , i came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast .
the toast was good , but i was too full to keep eating .
based on this one experience , i would come only for the pancakes .
service was really bad even though the place was half empty .
located in not such a great part of town .
food is just ok , grease upon grease .
waitresses do not make much of an effort .
we ordered wings and pierogies for appetizers , for which we waited _num_ minutes .
the wings were dry .
he did nothing to compensate us for the long wait .
this place is one of only a couple open in the burgh _num_ hours .
that 's an automatic star in this dead city .
the only items that are good there are the bacon and toast .
the food just is n't that great .
yeah , that place is that old and that outdated .
no parking = no visit from me .
- it 's _num_ and they have no website or menu .
it would take less than _num_ day of their time .
- they want $ _num_ for cheese on their eggs .
their chicken is better too .
a few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food .
it 's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here .
and the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie saw .
i do n't have time for this , i 'm very busy '' .
no need to be nasty .
typical diner look and menu .
i really do n't get the hype as the food was average at best .
puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else .
do not make the mistake and eat here .
overall , my experience eating here has been inconsistent .
when it was brought back , there was a small hair in it .
soup not hot , waitress and cook fighting loudly .
cash only is not an acceptable policy in _num_ .
this trend has to stop , it is not ok .
i refuse to patronize any business that only accepts cash .
this is a scam and highly unacceptable .
i dropped off my standard prescription today , with the head pharmacist .
he could n't have told me that prior ?
i could taste absolutely nothing from her veal .
the salad was basic iceberg lettuce and a few other veggies .
then the bill came to over $ _num_ .
it was truly , truly just plain sad .
do n't waste your time !
after they microwaved it it was barely fit to eat .
some had flavorless chicken piccata , fish and eggplant parmigiana .
the only thing with an aroma in this place was the tomato sauce .
waited _num_ minutes for two glasses of wine .
it was very awkward considering it was a first date .
the drinks took forever , i had something floating in my wine .
the soup tasted spoiled , the tomatoes in my salad were frozen and mushy .
this place is trashy .
total dive bar with awful food and service .
neither of us touched our dinner , we were afraid to eat it .
diners beware , spend your money elsewhere .
not much for atmosphere .
the service , in my opinion , is often quite rude .
the `` ambiance '' is loud , dark , dingy and depressing .
sorry , but i just do n't get it .
this place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers .
the reason why i rate this place low is the atmosphere is abysmal .
i 've had better burgers almost everywhere .
i dropped them off while i parked the car .
she said they would n't seat them because i was n't there .
the burger was pretty good but , i 've had much better .
what i really did n't like about this place was the service .
we had to flag down our waitress just to get refills .
we were rushed through our meals like we were n't wanted !
nothing special here .
not sure what all the hype is about .
but the burger was n't memorable at all .
we proceed to wait another _num_ minutes until a _num_ top opened up .
never understood all the hype about this place .
the burgers are rather bland and burnt .
and the wait was always ridiculous to boot .
in practice , it 's not very pleasant to go there .
every interaction seems designed to make people feel awkward .
the burger just falls apart in your hands ( or onto your lap ) .
i was disappointed .
i had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay .
i did like the home fries , very yummy !
in all honesty i would 've rather had five guys or in-n-out burgers .
it 's not .
not even close .
i 've eaten there many times in the hopes that maybe i missed something .
oh but it 's not .
it 's not me .
it 's just not that good .
burgers are adequate - nothing special .
order something other than a burger and you do n't get much better .
this was my first and last time at this restaurant .
but i did n't send it back because i never send anything back .
i just ate it and it was a sloppy , greasy mess .
the bread was cheap and tasteless .
the home fries were just diced potatoes .
also , not one of us got ours cooked as ordered .
i just do n't understand the appeal .
i would consider a _num_ star rating if it were n't for them .
the decor is old school and seems satisfied in it 's current state .
however , it was absolutely nothing special .
also , the home fries were just mediocre .
i do n't understand all the rave reviews for this place .
as for me , i do n't think i 'll be back .
there did n't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever .
bland would be an understatement .
i had the kelly burger and it was just extremely massive and greasy .
the burger was so-so with little flavor , which was very disappointing .
the waitress made it seem as though it was my fault for bringing him .
the potato salad was awesome everything else was super sub par .
this is supposed to be the best burgers in the 'burgh .
if that were the case , i 'd stick to making my own .
baby on board , we walked in and waited to be greeted .
the inside looked a bit old and run down .
i would not suggest bringing a baby here .
the potatoes were very bland despite being served with warm butter on the side .
bad for an adult who is looking for something tasty .
this was not the case .
my burger was as dry as a burnt piece of chicken .
overall , tessaro 's fell flat and left me hung out to dry .
went once , only due to bad weather , and would never go again .
mediocre food and mediocre service .
_num_ of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks .
bad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around .
they also have a wind problem every time the front door is open .
clearly , customer service nor quality of food are valued .
the dust does n't end there .
_num_ of us plus drinks was $ _num_ .
worst service and seating ever !
food is ok but the service is a thumb down .
i would never come back .
for me , eating at tessaro 's is like eating a costco hotdog .
maybe i should cut down on the costco dogs ?
staff was friendly and drinks were reasonable but nothing to rave about .
however , i wo n't be back .
terrible service .
was really excited to try this out .
did n't wait long to be seated .
but waited over _num_ minutes for them to take our order .
waitresses were overwhelmed and avoided us .
lack concern makes me wonder if we will be back .
the wait for someone to take our drink order was rather long .
i 'm used to ordering medium and getting medium well at least .
i do n't see why people really like this place .
they were soggy , and not crispy at all .
there are better places in pittsburgh to get a burger and fries .
it seems as if this place is now more hit or miss .
the food went from amazing to mediocre without missing a beat .
even worse , no seasoning whatsoever .
probably not .
so , i am fed up with bad service from this state farm office .
no effing way .
just my experience , but come on people , really ?
i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time .
we walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table .
i was excited about dining at this place before _num_ minutes of frustration .
stuffed mushrooms , but my seafood pasta just came up bland and too oily .
the broccoli in it was overcooked and the shrimp were undercooked .
if i could give negative stars i certainly would for this place .
i walked in sat down , greeted by friendly staff and great decor .
we sat outside and the service was very slow .
tonight , however , was just awful .
it was way too thick and absolutely tasteless .
it tasted like that yellow spray they use on grills .
the waitress did n't take the coke off of the bill until i asked .
it was very crowded due to little italy days in bloomfield .
we should have requested another waitress at that moment .
would never consider going back .
there were nine people in the bar section .
yelp need to have a zero rating for places like this .
just awful .
my boyfriend and i went to dinner here last saturday .
our food took forever and when it got there i was highly disappointed .
my alfredo was tasteless .
the veal was soggy and chewy and the sauce was sub par .
took nearly two hours for everyone in our party to get our food .
this was really disappointing .
i went out with three others on a friday night to grab some dinner .
unfortunately , we were all pretty underwhelmed with most of the dinner .
crispy on the outside , creamy and cheesy on the inside .
the entrees , however , left much to be desired .
everything tasted like nothing .
everything was just bland and disappointing .
pasta was watery and very limp .
presentation was so so and the taste of the food was mediocre .
i will not be returning .
these guys are definitely lazy !
pesto gnocchi okay , tiramisu okay ( except for the canned whipped cream ) .
_num_ star for food , gross !
_num_ stars for plate glass window people watching !
i had the linguine carbonara and it was more like scrambled eggs and noodles .
bland noodles .
i really would n't go back again .
( this becomes important later . )
they were significantly cheaper .
we waited fifteen or so minutes , the shots were consumed , etc .
( i believe it was $ _num_ total . )
i felt terrible for her in that situation .
nobody else even ordered drinks while we were there .
but this was not what i had in mind .
but the bed was a big disappointment .
the mattress was borderline uncomfortable .
i would not stay here , it 's not worth the money they charge .
my room came with an awesome jacuzzi .
looking into this place , they have no website .
there is no excuse .
i should n't have to look for something , it should obviously be there .
i read online that it opened at 11am , wrong .
it opens at _num_ .
not a good first impression .
not good .
thankfully they give it to me without further lip .
total for one waffle cone with sprinkles = $ _num_ .
the ice cream was nothing special .
not here .
but there 's nothing special about this place .
make sure your opening and closing time is listed correctly .
rating - _num_ out of _num_ .
it was generous for the `` _num_ scoop '' order .
in the future i 'll stick with scoops for my neighborhood ice cream fix .
coming here was usually pretty exciting .
( here as in the city , not silky 's . )
this place is just not our usual dive bar .
i was not even acknowledged .
this was a moderately steady thursday night .
i was n't standing behind the people 's sitting at the bar .
by `` multiple times '' i mean _num_ or _num_ times .
they would n't look at me .
this is about _num_ minutes after i arrived .
`` ill tell the waitress . ''
me : `` please may i just have my beer ? ''
it 's extremely frustrating .
my experience here was terrible .
a _num_ minute wait for a draft beer on a slow night ?
no thanks .
just there last evening after a _num_ hour shift at work .
the server apologized and offered to get the correct sandwhich for me to go .
not impressed .
the juice from the tacos also made the tater tots extremely soggy .
everyone else in my group was disappointed in some way with our visit .
mediocre food and also over-priced .
this silky 's pub place is a complete joke .
out of five orders , only two were done correctly .
he talked loudly across the whole restaurant to staff members back in the kitchen .
what could have been a very positive experience was absolutely ruined by this man .
so , yeah , the smell .
you play russian roulette with your quarters every time .
lol is the most expensive laundromat i 've ever been to !
so why is laundry on liberty so expensive and so busted ?
now i 'm sad , real sad .
the front staff is very curt and short .
edit : in my original review i stated this procedure was $ _num_ .
for my car the average oil change runs about $ _num_ .
on most visits it takes em about _num_ minutes .
no problems with my oil change .
honesty today must have been forgotten .
and that they were going to charge me $ _num_ for it .
they cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair .
avoid at all cost .
they will ruin your car .
terrible experience .
overpriced , terrible customer service , and long wait times .
i went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change .
very bad service .
they are extremely slow .
when i told them that , they just lied and said they did .
this place sucks .
they are incredibly slow and ridiculously over priced .
the gentleman told me it would be about _num_ minutes .
very long wait .
very very slow service .
the workers do n't seem to care about how long it takes to wait .
jiffy lube sucked .
took over an hour , cost $ _num_ , broke my air filter .
um , hello ... how about an apology for wasting my time ?
no thanks .
there was absolutely no salt of them when they came out .
the turkey burger was seasoned well , but it was dry as a bone .
lot _num_ is ultimately a forgettable lunch destination .
too busy with your iphone ?
my merlot was decent but the calamari was not .
plus i think i found a fry or two with the vegetables .
also lot _num_ had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there .
service could have been better .
i might return for drinks but only drinks .
the food is bad !
boring .
this appetizer reminded me of my mother 's irish cooking : tasteless .
a simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem .
entree _num_ : beer battered fish and mac and cheese .
entree _num_ : fish tacos .
ok , so they were n't bad , but the fish was dry .
the attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream .
the chef , however , needs a bit of training .
i am hoping that my experience here was an off night .
there was only one waitress on for the whole restaurant , upstairs and down .
another twenty six minutes pass and husbands food comes .
both the waitress and the bartender were downright hostile .
not my scene .
the food is mediocre ( at best ) .
the place is a total dump .
we ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed .
a breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it .
it just is n't for me .
this place has the worst french fries i have ever tasted .
all i tasted was burnt oil .
i could not even eat one !
also the sandwich did not stick together like a melted sandwich should .
ugh .
_num_ out of _num_ is not great .
i am so disappointed .
disgusting .
do not eat here .
i spent $ _num_ for only one edible thing worth $ _num_ .
so pissed !
the sign says it , the looks of this place are not the best .
i 've had much worse .
disappointing .
pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best .
wine selection is very weak .
eggplant parm was a little better than average .
i 'm sorry , this place is simply not good .
unfortunately , it is yet another example of poorly made americanized italian food .
yes bread , this is not your best .
contrary to popular believe , this is not traditional italian !
this is what some would refer to as , terrible and heavy .
words could not describe my disappointment .
i 'll admit it , i 'm already an italian food snob .
is this what italian food in pittsburgh has come too ?
not real italian .
imitation crab meat at an italian restaurant does n't fly .
do n't worry but i wo n't come close to this restaurant again .
i was n't really a fan .
i 've made much better at home .
which was dry , overcooked and lukewarm .
did we catch them on a bad day ?
today , half the lettuce i had on my caesar salad was rotten .
i have no idea why it ever left the kitchen .
thanks but probably wo n't be back .
both meals were served barely warm .
the decor was old _num_ 's which could have charm but this did n't .
both plates were mediocre at best .
this was my first time here and i will never go back .
to start off when we walked in the place reeked of piss .
oh and that 's not the end of it .
i paid _num_ $ all together and it should have been free .
alexander 's offers some of the worst italian food i 've ever had .
unfortunately , the entrees were no better .
my girlfriend ordered chicken alfredo .
my mom ordered the mushroom ravioli , which was completely bland .
needless to say , my cannoli was awful .
do n't expect fresh food .
i was extremely disappointed w/ my experience at alexander 's last evening .
i had visited this restaurant in the past and remember it being much better ?
first of all , house chianti tasted like vinegar .
however , we were not offered any and forgot about it until this morning .
i am _num_ and i was probably youngest patron .
if you are looking for culinary experience avoid it .
it was a small side salad of iceberg lettuce and croutons with italian dressing .
what i received reminded me of mrs grass soup .
really bad italian food .
probably the worst i 've ever had .
the worst american version of italian food .
if you 're famous , why is there never anyone in your restaurant ?
the sandwich itself was , well , mediocre at best .
prices were okay , but no great bargain .
i have n't been back .
i rarely write negative reviews .
what a disappointment .
the salad was nothing special .
the spring rolls were nothing special and heavy on something off flavored .
the server got my order wrong .
i think it was overpriced for a pittsburgh restaurant as well .
this place was horrible .
i was very excited to try this place .
the pad thai was dry and tasteless .
i agree _num_ % on maggie g 's review .
ill pass i 've had better thai for less .
no more trying out different thai places in the city .
the food at thai cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction .
the carrots and broccoli was cooked beyond recognition .
okay thai food , nothing special , and overpriced .
ordered the eggplant with shrimp , veggie fried rice , and chicken satay .
eggplant was okay but lacked adequate quantities of shrimp .
however , would n't say this is very authentic thai food .
this was gross and a waste of _num_ dollars .
thai gourmet a few blocks down is awesome ... too bad they were closed .
the spring rolls were good and the dipping sauce was ok , nothing special .
i did n't think it was that good .
worst thai restaurant in pittsburgh .
i was greatly disappointed by this restaurant .
the place was very busy and noisy .
further , there did n't seem to be any seasoning on the steak .
it was tough and boring .
unfortunately , my head is sometimes up my own behind .
the place was much less noisy and crowded at my second visit .
the wings were awful .
they were large , tough and tasteless .
the sauce they were drowning in seemed to have almost a chemical taste .
the pasta dish would have been very good had it been seasoned enough .
the shrimp were perfectly cooked , though , and i was thankful for that .
nevertheless , i will not go there , again .
do n't waste your money !
my favorite sauce was the honey jalapeno .
they also did away with the _num_ cent wing night .
i just had the worst meal ever here .
very strange place .
not a big deal just thought it odd .
just meh sorta flavorless .
good place _num_ a large group to drink get apps tho .
went to getaway last night for famous fajitas .
decided to give them another chance and was disappointed .
5:30 on a saturday and only two other tables were occupied .
at noon on a friday i called getaway to place an order for wings .
i told my friend to forget about it .
( oh , heck no ! )
my wife ended up going to the bathroom for paper towels .
what an awful experience .
my steak hoagie was actually two mini sandwiches .
i would n't recommend it .
sorry chef jeff .
absolutely horrible service .
no thanks .
in a word : forgettable .
the last take-out pie we got was less than pleasing to the eye .
it 's not 5-star , it 's pizza .
i suspect it would be really delicious cold , for breakfast .
it was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat .
stopped by fiori 's , have n't been there in years .
the pizza was just sweet without much other taste , almost like ketchup !
this place is popular , but it is just is not for me !
i really do n't understand the hype of this place .
the pizza was just ok .
it was decently greasy and the crust was n't all that special .
sure , it 's friday a busy night so an hour seemed reasonable .
it took another _num_ minutes before he actually got the pizza .
_num_ hour and _num_ mins is ridiculously long to wait !
they should have cut off orders if they were that overwhelmed !
the sauce tasted like sugar and the crust was bland .
after that , everything else is what i consider the personal taste part .
the sauce was to sweet and the cheese was not right to me .
i wo n't be going back , just because my personal taste .
that was really unprofessional .
the bottom and the top rated with grease .
it was disgusting .
the red sauce tasted like it was ketchup with sugar added .
loaded with cheese that had pools of grease swimming on it .
it was still dripping with grease .
i removed the cheese and just ate the crust with the vegetables .
i assure you this place is n't it .
garbage !
after all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude .
the pie it self was a real mess .
the dough is some of the worst dough i have had yet in pittsburgh .
it is very dense and flavorless with no crunch at all .
its a dry dough too , very dry .
the sauce is very forgettable and watery .
and just leave this one alone .
i am giving it a _num_ out of _num_ .
really do n't get the high praise for their pizza .
their sauce is so thin and tasteless .
the cheese is almost too much .
i was quickly greeted by paul - who was great !
they continued to stare for several minutes , unbelievably unprofessional .
sadly i will never purchase a vehicle here again because of this experience .
which you failed , because of your tire .
you could leave a message , but they 'll never get back to you .
do n't waste your time and money here .
then shortly after , i needed to replace the alternator or the like .
this was a friday , and he said he 'd call back on monday .
monday , tuesday and wednesday came and went .
first , their clothing is arranged by color , not by size .
the upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store .
we wo n't be back to this one .
was n't worth it for me .
parking sucks .
just really lots of junk .
it is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude .
i 'd rather spend my money at goodwill !
this used to be one of my favorite thrift stores .
it is now grossly over priced .
and it seems like everybody that goes in there are trashy and rude .
it tends to bring in the worst of people .
get the diagnosis and get several estimates to compare .
it seems like all these hvac guys are out to take advantage .
do not use , awful experience !
my house is under 1,000 sf .
he was there for approximately _num_ minutes .
i feel ripped off .
very sad to find that donuts are made the day before .
same goes for the provolone wheel .
the bread was not fresh either .
i 'm genuinely disappointed with the recent changes .
we stuck it out and left with no intention to return .
the icing was not damaged though as they were so stale they were hard .
so i contacted this bakery for a wedding cake approximately _num_ months in advance .
i do n't regret it at all .
what a nightmare !
the cupcakes were average at best .
sadly , yelp failed me this time around .
( _num_ ) i called multiple times but could n't reach anyone .
( _num_ ) left messages and no one called me back .
( _num_ ) they do n't have ready access to email .
if you send them an email , they do n't check it .
brutal .
they just do n't run a very professional operation .
terrible !
only had a bite of that and threw it away .
owner is a terrible terrible person .
tossed me out for no good reason .
it was like pizza soup in a crust bowl .
they do not cook directly on the brick though , they use pizza screens .
they are wasting so much money on cheese its sad .
fake words aside , this pizza really sucks guys .
this was our first time trying this place since moving to castle shannon .
the pizza was really really greasy .
we also got an order of _num_ hot wings .
they were also extremely greasy and had zero flavor of any kind of sauce .
their texture was rubbery and they had a `` reheated '' taste to them .
they were pretty terrible .
we wo n't be ordering from here again .
completely unprofessional and ridiculous .
none of this is exaggeration .
almost every order i 've placed had something forgotten or incorrect .
literally the worst experience ever .
only _num_ stars .
yelp as well as the online website said they close at _num_ .
worst mcdonalds !
someone needs fired !
seriously the worst mcdonalds i 've ever been to .
service is always slow .
but the situation inside is fairly ridiculous .
every mcdonalds has employees that hate their job , but never show it .
i hate this location .
every time , we have a worse experience with customer service .
my cashier never handed me a cup for my drink .
over time i 've been ignored , greeted with `` what do you want ?
worst service ever !
heck no !
worst experience ever !
will defiantly not go there again !
this leaves the meat dry and tasteless .
hostess was great , service was adequate .
the food is terrible .
if i could give zero stars i would .
ugh .
terrible food .
disgusting food .
third terrible .
the entrees are horrible .
the apps were good but do n't eat dinner you 'll regret it .
never going back .
this used to be one of our favorite restaurants .
the new pitas tasted like a doughy pancake .
my wife 's dinner was bland .
it was that bad .
my hope is that they fix their problems .
avoid at all costs .
i would n't go back .
well , this place is beyond horrible .
if i could give negative stars i would .
the service , however , was terrible .
no wonder the service was horrible !
will never stop here again .
horrible , rude service .
_num_ minute wait for fast food ?
made me feel uncomfortable , he was kinda nasty and condescending .
however , every times i drive thru pittsburgh , i always stopped here .
furthermore , i have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce .
shrimp was hard to chew .
there was no aroma from garlic or onion .
i suspect this is probably made by the guy who station the fryer .
i purchase those passing pittsburgh , not really possible asking for refund .
it was so bad , i would not dear to try again .
i could n't eat it .
this is n't the first time that i have had this problem here .
takeout is gross .
i wo n't be back .
no changing tables in the bathroom .
no chop sticks or soy sauce unless you ask for it .
interior is dark and dated .
dry rice , no flavor , greasy .
wonton soup and a mediocre fortune earns this one ( _num_ ) golden star .
it was my last time , i will ever stop again .
stopped in with my daughter we just wanted something small to eat .
i left and very disappointed .
i have been a customer of sesame inn for many , many years .
two stars because they seem to not be able to get it together .
people were sat after us and have already received food .
either case , i 'm not thrilled .
not that the food was bad it just was n't good !
never ever get the all-you-can-eat .
they give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi .
also , service was unfriendly .
my son and i stopped by china gate after a movie in the galleria .
there was no way this order was prepared and cooked that fast .
i refused .
there is such a thing as food too fast .
tonight was the worst experience we have had for a very long time .
and another which was not the one my husband had ordered .
the restaurant is understaffed , poorly managed , and the staff is badly trained .
too bad .
one star for the unpleasant experience i have had at this store .
it 's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect .
i will not be returning here for any musical needs .
i was a bridesmaid very recently and the bride got her dress here .
the dress comes in _num_ months later and is the wrong color .
i would never recommend this boutique to a bride unless you want added stress .
there are plenty of other bridal salons that would be much nicer and accommodating .
incredibly unfriendly staff , completely clueless consultant .
if i asked the price , she did n't know and did n't look .
think twice people before going here .
update : i received a very much appreciated phone call from the owner today .
she stated that she would go ask to see if something could be done .
they of course could care less about me .
what horrible service this place gives !
i wish i could give this no stars and a thumbs down !
the bride chose a dress hoping it would look better in a smaller size .
they know my measurements , they should know what size i should get !
the cost of the alterations were $ _num_ !
to date that has not happened .
the selection was not unique , though there were plenty of dresses .
it seems ridiculous , actually .
in addition , the knowledge of the associate was lackluster .
the oven was way too hot for this type of pizza .
it was also an outrageous $ _num_ dollars .
it was also fairly small , but that was almost to be expected .
we also shared a pasta dish which was incredibly overpriced .
we also had a serious problem with the timing of the food .
hmm a bit misleading .
but my date returned and relaxed with a glass of wine as we chatted .
the blond hostess refused .
as for the food and drink , it was just fine .
i wo n't be coming here again .
essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings .
certainly , this was not worth the $ _num_ price .
our server was attentive , almost to a fault .
way overpriced for just ok food .
on a tuesday night , there was a long wait .
the food was prompt , and the salad was more than enough to share .
the pizza was simply ok .
also , do not use multiple credit cards .
our pizza was burnt .
it tasted like charcoal .
but told our server we could not eat the burnt pizza .
it was cold and not a good portion .
i got a huge hot pepper that burnt the crap out of my lip .
just not a good value for the $ .
there were n't even many toppings to make it soggy .
probably give it another shot but not my first choice considering the prices .
i ordered the margarita , sauce , cheese and basil .
it was a wet tasteless mess .
i may return if craving a good caesar .
we will not be going back .
friday night is apparently not the night to go .
you can wait for _num_ minutes at the wine bar . ''
we repeatedly got dirty looks from the staff throughout our meal though .
by 6:30 , there were still a number of empty tables .
then there 's the main restaurant that i really was n't that impressed with .
the food i ordered was penne alla vodka , which was pretty tasty .
but for $ _num_ , and that 's all you get ?
and never refilled our empty water glasses .
lo and behold at _num_ minutes it comes out .
bland and soggy as we 've ever tasted .
very rude .
worst service in years .
unimpressive food .
the pasta i got was good , but nothing to write home about .
the only thing i will give them credit for their italian wedding soup .
overall , not impressed .
i probably wo n't return .
this used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat .
i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .
sadly i can not support a business that provides such poor service .
no salad .
no meat .
no dice .
better deals and better food at a mall food court .
$ _num_ for wedding soup ?
$ _num_ for gnocchi ?
no more .
what was worse was the pizza was just average .
it 's so cold - like sit with your coat on cold .
so disappointed .
we dined rather early , so there was no wait .
overall , a disappointing dining experience .
however , there were three hostesses at the bar chatting and seemingly doing nothing .
the restaurant was by no means crowded ( this was a sunday ) .
it does n't make sense .
the wine : _num_ inches served in a huge glass .
with all of the fabulous choices in the south hills , pick another destination .
this restaurant is going downhill .
first thing i knew was iffy was the meat and cheese plate .
they replaced the normal wooden board , and replaced it with a plate .
a white , boring , incredibly small plate .
food remains ok but prices have more than doubled .
i do n't return on principle .
their market square location worse .
waitress has n't checked on us in half an hour .
would rate the food , but have no clue because we are still waiting .
ridiculous .
waiter was not thrilled to be at work on a wednesday at 5pm .
my pizza was okay , nothing yummy .
way too over priced .
go for drinks and nothing more .
i 've been wanting to try this place for awhile .
disappointed but not giving up , we ordered one of each and proceeded .
the bread was thick and doughy ( clearly a filler ) .
i eat out almost every night of the week .
it doesnt taste like an actual japanese cuisine , it is very chinese .
and i can smell chinese food right after a few second entering the restaurant .
i expected bland sushi .
but hey , it 's pittsburgh .
let 's face it , this is not japanese food .
the food is ok but it is really more or less chinese food .
man , was i wrong .
the sushi was not fresh .
the sushi was n't rolled tight either .
otherwise , i really would n't recommend this place to other people .
there are no descriptions for any of the rolls .
they do not offer low sodium soy sauce .
the wait for _num_ rolls and _num_ pieces of sashimi took over _num_ minutes .
actually , everything i ate was mushy .
the side soup is luke warm , soup should always be hot .
waited about another _num_ minutes after we finished our food to receive our check .
however , they deserve one star because they do have one amazing thing there .
their ginger dressing is unbelievable .
miso soup had an odd taste this visit .
our waitress was mia most of the night .
i did not have a good experience here tonight .
it was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled chinese chilli .
so disappointed .
we ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi .
false advertising at its best -- should n't that be illegal ?
a group was sat without the reservation ahead of us .
we have been ordering food from little tokyo for almost _num_ years now .
over the last _num_ months i have to report they have lost their edge .
this is not japanese food , period .
horrible .
i swear it was worse than my first experience .
the locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds .
the dough has that typical bad salty cracker pittsburgh type taste to it .
the flavor of the dough is generic and salty .
the dough was also fairly dense .
the cheese ruined this pie .
all in all this pizza just sucks .
some good some bad .
even burger king does n't microwave their breakfast !
the chili soup was n't hot .
neither of us had cash on us , ( umm ... sorry ? )
the screens were tiny and the women 's restroom smelled of stale piss .
odds are , you 'd get a better experience at home .
such a shame .
filthy , bad seats , more expensive than others .
we wo n't return here .
she said she did n't care and her manager did n't care .
i did n't care .
i sat in the little snack area and drank it .
overpriced snacks , and the sound on the movie was awful .
why does this place always smell bad ?
this is not only a bad business practice but it is illegal and fraud .
food is n't that great .
lots of tv 's though .
just do n't expect to get anything else out of it .
the ambiance is a little strange .
the service was also overwhelmed and really slow .
the service was terrible .
sorry , not sorry .
this place does n't do it for me at all .
do n't bother eating here .
a complete waste of money , avoid at all costs .
avoid at all cost .
_num_ there service is awful , _num_ there prices are awful .
sad to see it go .
but i 'm sure the mall 's rent killed them .
sad to see it go .
at the time , it was the premier cigar shop in the pittsburgh area .
the store is extremely pricey and nothing really interested us .
last week i went in with a busted window screen frame .
now it wo n't fit .
she slowly responded `` yeah '' hardly looking up .
i stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off .
i guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible .
i am so frustrated with this service .
i should have just gone to giant eagle .
very disappointed .
this was a horrible experience .
i am extremely disappointed and will never order or recommend them for anything !
the galleria ... it 's definitely catered to the upper class .
i really do n't have much desire to go here !
management will not care about your complaint and certainly will not apologize .
and , no , i 'm not making this up .
to which my response would have been , `` oh i 'm so sorry .
none of them responded to me .
the management team of this mall would get negative stars if that was possible .
after getting my `` window '' they never showed up .
no call , nothing .
i sat around for an entire saturday waiting and no one ever called me .
it was horrible .
they also promised me a partial refund for my massive inconvenience .
i should have refused delivery and just got my money back .
i asked them three times to please try and they refused all three times .
if you are going to shop here , do not use their delivery service .
wo n't be going back .
wo n't be going back .
worst experience with a hairdresser ever , at this location .
yeah , that 's why i booked one at your salon .
horrible salon ... dirty , also , just as a side note .
online , their women 's haircut price is quoted at $ 30+ .
no , she went ahead anyway .
so go there instead is the best advice i can give .
for many , many years i had the same massage therapist .
massage but still had a _num_ hr .
wait which i left to run some errands .
it is very disappointing after having wonderful experiences here for over _num_ decades !
the worst salon experience of my life .
i gave her the benefit of the doubt & i completely regret it .
the first visit took almost seven hours , not _num_ .
it looked horrible .
she left about 1-2 inches of my naturally black roots !
i felt horrible .
she 's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose .
she damaged my hair so badly i ended up having _num_ inches cut off .
i would give them zero stars if that was an option .
this place sucks .
they still have not apologized when they lost her insurance card .
i paid $ _num_ for shipping .
weird experience .
i have no clue what they gave me .
they just wanted to work , i guess .
i chose a sugar cookie and mexican cookie .
i 'm not wasting my calories on a bad cookie .
the mexican cookie was just the same consistency .
sorry buds !
the lady who works their , is super rude and never smiles .
the customer almost feels like they are bothering the workers .
it 's always dirty .
do n't think the floor has ever been washed .
it 's like they hate their lives .
wish there was a choice of no stars .
there was no noise control so sleep was impossible .
absurd .
horrible experience .
quite possibly the worst experience i have ever had dealing with a clothing store .
why would i spend hundreds of dollars on more suits ?
overpriced merchandise that does not last .
even the shoes fell apart after a few months .
purchased two suits and other items for my son , spending over $ _num_ .
i could understand if they were worn a lot , but they were not .
my recommendation would be to not buy suits , shirts or shoes here .
the salespeople are not pushy .
the team went out of their way to get us in quickly and efficiently .
the closet doors would keep falling off onto my little children .
we called about the issue and they sent someone over right away .
my overall point is just be careful working with them .
and not giving real receipts ( they use hand written ones ! )
i rest my case : avoid ten toes on walnut ladies !
losing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless .
the coffee is okay , nothing special .
this place just keeps getting worse and worse .
started with the bathrooms ... rarely cleaned , rarely working .
so long story short , this place is packed .
it 's a little annoying .
i 'm not a coffee snob i can do with it or without it .
but it seemed like i was absolutely bothering the staff this morning .
i 'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear .
felt like i was in someone else 's hood .
get over yourselves people .
if you 've got stuff to do , do n't bother coming here .
they apparently do n't care about your time or money .
servers here can be really rude .
it was n't even that she said it .
i wo n't be back .
the wifi signal is weak .
the drinks are not so great .
the frozen carmel coffee drink was much better than fruit smoothie .
it was gross .
slightly better than starbucks , but that 's not saying much .
it 's sad to me that someone would open a coffee shop like this .
so i decide to try a coffee tree for once .
i walk in , look around , look at the menu ... hmmm .
sorry , just not interested .
it must not have been bad because i do n't remember anything about it .
minus _num_ stars for not being much better than starbucks .
unfortunately , the wi-fi here is miserable .
its connection is also very spotty .
for a coffee shop , the food and drinks here are mediocre at best .
that 's about where the positives stop .
wifi is spotty .
espresso is pretty bad .
i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning .
this place is out of my dry cleaning budget !
its owner , gary , enjoys parking in handicapped parking spaces .
this time , the staff were new , loud and mean .
as chance would have it , the owner gary was around .
the damage was done .
they just keep finding excuses and trying not to be responsible for it .
so disappointed !
i interacted with staff to get help with a machine that was n't working .
do n't expect any help when things get ruined .
i usually do both dry cleaning and wash and fold here .
i will never do any business with this jerk off ever again .
i have never been treated so rudely in my entire life .
i told him that i would rather donate the items to a theater .
will never return to the store .
i went here to fix a bad hair cut at the last minute .
i was livid and called to complain .
they offered me nothing .
terrible customer service will never book with them again .
my experience did not live up to my expectations at all .
i could have gotten a better wax at a cheap nail salon .
my eyebrow still has n't grown back to its normal shape .
not worth your money !
i wo n't be going back to see him again .
this place is awful .
i mean , so so bad .
she rushed me into picking colors for my nails and toes .
water temp on the chair got too cold too fast .
absolutely horrible customer service .
not sure what star rating to give .
it 's happened everytime i go and it 's really unprofessional .
as for beverages , they really skimp .
despite the spa pricing this is not the spa treatment .
price was as i expected for a nice looking salon .
the bed was dirty too .
gross .
she was clearly in a hurry .
well what a mistake i made .
they booked me with a guy by the name of jason .
it cost me _num_ to get extensions so my hair looked thicker .
i can not recommend this salon .
( $ _num_ for a hair cut i was n't satisfied with ) .
ok , so i really wanted to like this place .
that 's about as far as it goes though .
the haircut was $ _num_ .
they did n't wash my hair and the haircut took about _num_ minutes .
then , i went to go hang out with my best friend immediately after .
they charge me for their mistake .
but that 's apparently the way they do it .
the head massage was painful and rough .
i probably wo n't be returning for a hair appointment .
but i am not rushing back .
so disappointed with this place .
so disappointed with this place .
poor customer service and they were rude .
i was disappointed .
i am not a fan of this place .
please do not give them business .
you are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner .
first , they messed up one of our pants badly .
when i say they messed up one of our pants , they destroyed it .
rather , they were extremely rude and defensive .
for your own sake and peace of mind , do not give them business .
do not use this cleaner .
quality is poor .
refused to replace them or compensate me for the loss .
they do not stand by their mistakes .
have been waiting for _num_ business shirts and suits for over _num_ weeks .
customer service is poor .
this place is extremely overrated .
the salmon was ok but not worth the $ _num_ either .
i 've been here a few times and have always been disappointed .
last night the service was especially lackluster .
the first time i went it was okay , but was very forgettable .
unfortunately , the food was mixed .
i had the chicken ramen soup for a main course .
it just was n't very good .
this includes the broth and the chicken .
as it is , i wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
dear pittsburgh , we are foodies from boston .
it 's unacceptable .
a restaurant like just should be nowhere near your top _num_ .
i would prefer to leave _num_ stars .
the pancakes were ok , a little mushy but flavorful .
i wish i could remember the other thing , but it was better .
when the bill comes , it is _num_ dollars .
and is _num_ dollars a glass .
drinking scotch in pittsburgh has been fun so far .
for appetizer , we had the kimchi pancakes , which were not fully cooked .
went to soba to celebrate my sons birthday .
quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price .
i wish they did n't put fried batter all over it though .
last i had the vegetarian curry dish , the only vegetarian main i found .
it was boring and not enough curry gravy with plain white rice !
the potatoes were also undercooked with not much flavor in the dish overall .
it was very cold .
everything took a long time to come out and the service was very poor .
needless to say i was extremely disappointed .
it was not enjoyable .
for the very first time the food was awful .
a pulled pork appetizer was passable , nowhere near the dish it replaced .
find a new chef quickly .
vietnamese beef noodles were bland and flavorless .
the menu lists them as including jalapeno , but there was no heat whatsoever .
very very disappointing .
thai corn soup jumbo crab ?
pad thai at a fusion place ?
tandoori salmon was average .
i still do n't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm .
a cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda ?
why were n't their any ice in the glass ?
maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas .
show off how much money you can waste in a night .
after the renovation the place lost its center !
... another one bites the dust !
wrong !
the server went out of her way to make us feel uncomfortable .
no , we did not order any super fancy dishes .
lost _num_ stars for that .
it was horrible .
the fish was tough and the other dish was simply inedible .
this place is far too expensive to be serving food poorly prepared .
way too much hype for such underwhelming food .
sadly , i was grossly disappointed .
it was nothing that would make me want to come back .
it was sad , really .
but it was downhill from there .
it was dry and average , at best .
and fallen far .
it 's just not that good .
nothing special .
service is sketchy here at best .
first off , i can not comment on the food .
so , we were n't allowed to sit at the bar or a table .
those expectations kind of fell flat .
service here on a saturday night was atrocious .
_num_ after tip .
it 's good , but too expensive .
i do n't think the price worth the food .
the portion is too small .
i mean really loud .
i have never placed a bad review of a restaurant until now .
i will not recommend this establishment in the future .
not planning to come back and recommend everyone to stay away from this place .
painfully mediocre : small rolls , $ _num_ miso soup , drinks were reasonable .
rolls small lacking substance .
boring and expensive .
however , i 'm in pittsburgh , where can i go ?
these place are virtually the same .
no ... these bagels are about the same you would get anywhere .
okay bagels though a little overpriced .
have consistently had rude customer service .
really turns me off .
wo n't be going back even though the bagels are okay .
i 'm not totally sure why i keep going back here .
it was super busy and only _num_ employees were making food .
the coffee 's terrible .
poor customer service .
not worth the time and money to go here .
i go once or twice a week roughly , but never again .
but then again he knows everything is crap in his store .
it 's all crap .
do you like egg & bacon bagel sandwiches ?
they 'll cook the egg and bacon in their crap microwave for you .
tastes like crap but whatever , they serve it .
just like the butter and jelly packets sitting in the booth at denny 's .
but do n't feel this way .
the fellow who runs this crap store may be one .
was somewhat disappointed with my order from bagel factory today .
not horrible , just nothing to write home about .
i just found the worst breakfast spot in pittsburgh .
i 'm not kidding .
the egg and cheese were disgusting .
worst place ever !
bad food - ordered a bagel sandwich - yuck !
and the customer service was horrible .
apparently the guy was the owner , but he was beyond rude .
the coffee was expensive and tasted like dirt .
avoid this place as all costs .
we also tried the hummus which was pretty good .
friends ordered a chicken sandwich and a chicken salad .
they both said they were pretty good , if not a little dry .
then we had to wait _num_ minutes to get our bill .
she was not present for about _num_ minutes after we were sat .
she disappeared for about _num_ minutes before returning .
she served us our drinks then immediately left for another table .
she returned not long after and said she was alright .
i really could n't believe this .
what the hell ?
this place is going downhill fast .
first off , our waitress just was n't good .
bacon does n't take that long to cook .
so , that was really disappointing .
but it was n't over .
there were literally exactly four sad little pieces .
only because i live nearby .
this place just bored me .
really do n't know what to say .
bored , bored , bored , bored , bored .
mmm not too happy with my recent experience at harris grill .
we ended up with our glasses 3/4 full and a watered down juice cocktail .
ours was n't plain and simple .
harris grill , i think your menu is trying too hard .
first place i went on my visit to pittsburgh .
i do n't really have a good review for this place .
bland and overcooked .
it 's not even good bacon !
i have nothing good to say about this place .
waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu .
avoid harris grill .
this place offers really poor service .
the waitstaff go out of their way to not help you .
we stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter .
i do n't enjoy doing it .
almost every time i have been let down .
appetizers : nothing really wrong here .
$ _num_ for two fish tacos ?
i do n't hate anything on the harris grill menu .
sure , harris grill gets crowded , especially on the weekends .
no apologies , no offer to comp a side or a dessert .
bad form , harris grill .
but truth be told , i 'll probably be back .
because i really want to like harris grill .
the food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best .
i thought the selection on the menu was pretty poor .
then the waitress asked me if i knew the chicken itself was spicy .
the menu said nothing about that , so i had no idea .
zero stars for service .
zero stars for price .
once seated , service was extremely slow .
_num_ min from when seated . )
service remained poor .
the place was mostly empty .
not so much .
terrible .
but again we watched table after table go empty and stay dirty .
and then the waitress only brought two of the three beverages .
the third took another _num_ minutes .
the menu was prix fixed at $ _num_ .
( they had run out of home fries ) .
my eggs benedict was good , so was my bloody mary .
that said , i counted only _num_ dishes with any vegetables at all .
the coffee was disappointing -- it came with plastic cups of half & half .
was n't impressed by their sunday brunch .
did n't like the presentation of the buffet .
the salad was made with iceberg lettuce and did n't look appetizing .
in all , it 's really nothing special , just very basic .
there 're not much options on the menu .
i tried the pasta once and it was tasteless .
so i was in need of a lunch and off to the garden .
two grape size tomatoes , and two thin slices of cucumber .
i do n't understand why this place is so popular .
i 've been there _num_ times and each time the food was pretty gross .
the only option for brunch is to get the buffet .
they were packed and could n't keep enough food out .
and , insult to injury , my bloody mary was watered down .
very hit or miss place .
i will never go back to this place again !
it was calamari on top of some salad with thai chili sauce dressing .
it is just disgusting .
i stay _num_ blocks away from harris grill .
what turns me off a bit , it always seems dirty .
the bathroom smells , the menus seem filthy , but i like the food !
terrible terrible service .
seemed cranky and overworked and ruined the experience completely .
ugh .
horrible experience .
salmon salad was not good at all .
will not be going back ever .
my _num_ star is as misleading as their drink menu .
we greeted her before she greeted us which i find rude .
she did not ask us anything when we were shopping .
she just sat there and read a magazine .
never , ever use these incompetent people for property management .
we 've had too many problems to list all of them .
we ca n't pay something if we do n't know how much to pay .
so completely frustrating .
the equipment would often break down and never get fixed .
it was hard to find a machine .
terribly overrated .
the actual equipment is ok , but the locker rooms are pretty bad .
the reason you would stick to this gym is the classes .
parking is difficult to come by , and you have to pay .
there has to be better gyms in the area .
terrible experience !
very disappointing and frustrating .
gross much ?
the gym also has barely any lighting .
its ridiculous and the policy needs to be changed asap .
update ... shadyside inn refunded the charges from our stay .
the building we stayed in was not full .
if i could give the place zero stars , i would .
great location but low on amenities .
`` it 's not coming off !
also most hotels offer no free parking , shadyside suites did .
the bedroom however seemed to dull car noise a little better .
hot water , not much of it low water pressure as well .
pros : it 's like living in an apt .
some of the staff has been friendly in providing things , including shuttle rides .
cons : extremely inconsistent room cleaning service !
the problem is , they do n't show on the assigned day to clean .
we stayed at the shadyside inn for months and spent thousands of dollars .
i really wanted to write a good review , but the experience was disappointing .
the quality of service from the staff was inconsistent .
and the elevator did not work at times .
we will not stay at this hotel again .
i 've never been so horribly treated in my life .
do not stay here .
nothing special about this place .
great location but the facilities are a little tired .
the management at this restaurant is horrendous .
i 've been here twice and i 'm just not crazy about it .
nothing is bad , per se , just not really impressive .
the big green salad was boring and everything was in huge chunks .
they have a hot vegetarian sandwich , but it sounds gross .
i would n't mind coming back for brunch .
she did n't rush us , and made good wine recommendations .
the burger was just a big slab of flavorless ground beef .
i could n't taste salt , pepper , garlic , anything .
their burgers are dead to me .
well , my update has half of my original rating .
i think she got _num_ out of every _num_ drink orders correct .
it was not crowded and we were seated and served promptly .
makes no sense .
worst eggs benedict experience i 've ever had .
additionally , i was not too thrilled with the atmosphere or beer selection .
the fries were fairly soggy and otherwise par for the course .
so tired of this place .
i thought maybe the cook was having a bad night .
the balsamic vinaigrette was straight vinegar .
where do you find apples and feta cheese with no taste ?
butter served with the bread was so hard it bent the knife .
pity .
the bloody mary was completely disgusting .
and there was no alcohol in it .
it was god awful .
it was the same bagel , they just stuck it in the microwave .
had a pretty bad experience last time i went here .
the artichoke dip was ok , but very greasy .
the pasta a bit dry and bland as well .
there is an ok number of beers on tap .
the main courses are very low quality .
honestly , there were _num_ people in the restaurant .
my reuben sandwich was just okay .
probably should have gotten a salad .
i 'm hoping that i just caught them on a bad afternoon .
my lil heart fell .
i do n't know how this place has stayed in business for so long .
the menu is boring .
lettuce was ice cold , nearly frozen .
i hardly ever send food back or complain but this was really bad .
this place is hit or miss .
i 've had good meals here , and i 've had really bad ones .
there 's no pride in the service or the food at all .
sunny only offered a free cleaning and even then seemed annoyed .
could not have been more patronizing .
i would n't recommend richard or the salon to anyone .
the second haircut was great , but styled horribly .
the third haircut was just awful : styled awful , looked strange .
i went into dean of shadyside salon to get my hair colored .
the worst part was checking out .
are you kidding me ?
not pleased with all the hidden costs behind my hair color service .
wo n't be back .
this explains why i got my haircut there so many times .
each visit was more bizarre than the time before .
overall , my haircuts were never good .
and i might add , he knew i was sitting there waiting .
so bad service .
i was their with groupon and they gave me so bad service .
due to 3-4 hours of service i split it into two days .
terrible !
the receptionist can not handle tips at all .
i left extremely upset and no one cared .
terrible customer service !
this is not an exaggeration .
i paid $ _num_ for a partial .
i think i 'll find a place that 's a little more ... me .
overall , haircut & style = _num_ stars .
the towel the girl put out had large brown stains on it !
mani = _num_ star .
the stylist did n't come back after a couple minutes .
when i asked the receptionist where the stylist was , she did n't know .
the next time i returned , i made an appointment with a different stylist .
they did n't even reschedule my appointment with another stylist when she did .
needless to say , i will not be back .
i 've tried to like dean 's several times over the years .
and each time i 've gone , my haircut has been ... .
but the overall vibe is weird and the service sucks .
the technique of the haircut is so poor .
i will not come for the second time .
the service was bad and unfortunately the haircut was even worse .
i tried dean 's because i had a coupon for a free hair cut .
he was very busy working on multiple people at the same time .
i was there for over _num_ hours !
richard does not make you feel comfortable .
i was not impressed with the atmosphere of the salons either .
- i will take my aunt to asians or school in north hills .
it was more than once that i heard glass breaking .
so i might not be the target audience .
the specials and menu prices are apparently wrong .
this is the worst lay out ever for a bar .
pricing is horrendous for beers .
weekend : dont bother .
i have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life .
drink prices are n't anything special and cocktails are n't that strong .
went in there with friends knowing `` friends '' but everyone was rude .
unless you 're a local do n't go in there .
so i 'm not sure how much he 'd approve of this bar .
not a lot of character , but cheap prices .
needless to say , i will never come back here .
i use to pass by this place all the time .
this is a neighborhood denny 's with a bar .
at best , less than mediocre breakfast .
service was slow but they were nice about it .
ca n't comment on food since i was just in for beers .
crappy 's is more like it ... sorry i could not resist !
this place is very below average .
hot sauce was more difficult , took two requests before it came .
the food is basic and inexpensive , you get what you pay for .
so clearly lil off there ... other then that we order common breakfast .
further , they were unapologetic when i complained .
horrible brunch experience .
in my opinion , the is a prime example of a bad shadyside bar .
i 'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible .
this is the worst spot on walnut st !
i 'm not even sure where to start .
the vegetables were n't even cooked .
the food was terrible .
i would rather have eaten a mcdonald 's burger and fries .
overall terrible over priced food experience .
i would recommend never eating here .
so disappointed in food and its cost .
went for brunch and spent $ _num_ .
was n't great .
was there for over _num_ hours because service was so incredibly slow .
it was n't even super busy .
for _num_ girlfriends , they brought _num_ joint check .
then , they are n't even that nice !
rude , crowded , and most importantly not that great !
nothing stood out , including the famous burnt almond torte .
sorry , i grew up in pgh .
the filling in the middle had a bland taste , nothing special about it .
being a pastry chef myself , i had to try it .
i did like that the almonds stayed crispy even through shipping .
i ate one slice , and gave the rest away .
the almond torte used to be the best , hands down .
but , something happened sadly .
the cake part is now dry ?
go back to the way it was done before .
maybe i just got an old cake , i do n't know .
but i 'm really disappointed .
shame on you .
dirty and old looking bakery .
burnt almond torte is not as good as i expected .
not best cake in america by a long shot .
i 've experienced better '' ) because i have .
they were sold out at 2:00 pm on a thursday .
no thanks .
i was given a _num_ dollar gift card .
on top of that the cake was n't even fresh .
the chocolate was too sweet .
horrible service .
i have never been treated so poorly in a cafe .
the service was horrible and their coffee did n't taste great .
this place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners .
they used to have a white mocha but not anymore .
i miss the old owner of the place .
pitiful service .
pamela is a bad representation of this location !
attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this `` employee . ''
they frequently mess up my friends orders when we go there .
the toppings on my salad were barely there .
the salad has been greatly reduced in size .
cutting too many corners .
simply gross .
i should have looked or felt it before i left the store .
( all same kind of cookie ) .
apparently old cookies are standard here .
service is actually friendly , but slow , and all the employees are weird .
and the store is dirty , just as others have said .
avoid until this store gets its act together .
the district manager of this bakery to make sure it does not happen again .
that exchange was awkward too .
it is absurd !
these people are very unprofessional and rude .
my main complaint with them is that they lied to me .
one of worst patient experiences .
his staff is embarrassed .
will not go back there , ever !
did n't havana go out of biz ?
if not , oops !
i only go in to buy six packs .
she was rude and all over the place .
hummus is ridiculously expensive .
juice is cheap .
every time we go here , we come out highly stressed , which sucks .
drama , drama , and more drama .
the entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk .
so incredibly frustrating !
not bad after hours but those hours are pretty narrow .
i woke up with a stuffy nose and in need of some hot soup .
this time it was runny bland mushy rice with extra mushy veggies .
gross !
plus i did n't feel great !
the small package was _num_ dollars .
selection of veggies are ok .
selection of fruit is a little below average .
however , lately i 'm becoming more and more frustrated by the store .
this is my third grocery store stop of the day .
for anyone who uses self checkout at this store do not forget your bags !
`` again i ask oh really is there nothing you can do ? ''
`` no i am sorry nothing we can do . ''
but going here is always such a nightmare .
the parking lot is miserable .
the aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size .
the romaine is especially pitiful .
it 's come to the point that i avoid this place if i can .
i do n't care for this giant eagle , and that is being kind .
wo n't be back .
items do n't have price tags .
that 's the only reason why i gave them such a poor mark .
none of that .
same goes for milk , cold cuts and breakfast meat products .
they also have fake sales .
instead of about _num_ '' _num_ '' it 's about _num_ '' thick .
i went there for a few grocery items along with some alcoholic beverages .
the only thing that saved this store were the nice people that worked there .
this giant eagle market district is garbage .
the cashiers , pharmacy , and customer service manager were so rude and stupid .
_num_ hours to find the cold remedy i wanted .
but why support a business that really does n't care about you .
the `` customer '' service and pharmacy are terrible at this location !
i checked out as quickly as possible and nearly ran out of the store .
after _num_ years i 'd hoped they would have improved but i was wrong .
guess not .
i mean , i understand you do n't care about _num_ dollars .
i never really understood why doc 's was so popular .
i personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck .
the drinks are weak as well .
entrees were half off but all looked mediocre .
big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service .
the beer selection is n't that great and the upstairs bar is not full .
the service can also be rather slow .
cheese fries , burgers , some salads , mediocre pasta , etc .
my feet were still rough .
to be smooth after only one pedicure . ''
excuse me ?
it was horrible .
ignoring the fact that i was unhappy and i did n't like it .
she just kept trying to cover her ass instead of listening to my concerns .
the front desk girls were not friendly or helpful as well .
it 's an embarrassment on walnut .
if i wanted them in _num_ days i would have paid $ _num_ less !
no such luck , they said they were not able to do that .
and you just lost all of our business .
disgusting .
does n't even deserve one star !
however , the customer service here is absolutely awful .
tiffany prices with kay jewelers selection .
unfortunately within _num_ days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing .
i 'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of .
however , this past visit was unfortunate .
the host was horrendous and extremely rude .
we were disappointed .
we mention our reservation , he says no problem _num_ min ... great !
okay , i know what you 're thinking why not just leave ?
i 've already admitted it 's nothing special .
but also way over prices .
really disappointing .
service is bad when you enter .
if it is busy expect to be treated poorly .
that will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else .
the food is poor .
the pasta was mushy -- way overcooked .
far too much cream and cheese .
did n't finish this dish .
my wife had a chicken special .
boring .
bland .
overall :
although there were some highlights , there were plenty of negatives to counter them .
not a good start .
disappointing .
not a good start .
very poor form on the owners part .
but when the bill came there was none of that .
i then turned around and walked out .
i have never been treated so badly as a consumer .
actually i will make sure to spread the word of this terrible experience .
and proceeded to scream at her for several minutes .
this was the most absurd display at a restaurant i have ever seen .
food was excellent but we hated the ambiance !
reservations at 7:00 pm saturday .
i guess that 's what they say to excuse the lack of proper a/c .
that completely turned us away from this restaurant .
very rude and unacceptable .
never going back .
ravioli , chicken breast , sauteed greens and a seasoned broth .
while the greens were decent , there were barely enough for a few bites .
we made the unfortunate decision to make a reservation here for a special occasion .
i wo n't be going here again .
luckily we had a fabulous dinner at another restaurant instead .
the owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience .
we submitted our name thinking it would be 20-30 mins .
as tables became available he would seat groups that he knew and/or had reservations .
my friends had left this woman at least a _num_ % tip .
that is the prime reason why i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .
the restaurant never called us , so we ended up eating elsewhere .
this time we literally got sat at a table in the kitchen hallway .
they should be serving free meals to anyone they stick at that table .
what a horrible experience !
it then took another _num_ minutes to get wine glasses .
this made everyone extremely uncomfortable !
the old guy continued to drink wine and yelled at another waitress .
so be aware they added an automatic _num_ % gratuity to the check .
life is too short to waste you time and money on this place !
very poor management .
very stupid management .
they do n't know how to do business .
they do n't help you to find a table .
come for the food and not the atmosphere or service .
i made reservations for _num_ pm on a friday .
the waitress who seemed to be rushed did not offer any recommendations .
aside from the poor service and chaos , the food was pretty good .
also , i was surprised by the limited number of seafood options .
the menu states there are _num_ market priced items .
prices were not listed on that daily special menu sheet either .
as dinner was my treat , i felt very awkward asking for prices .
note that risotto , the only entree with a price , is $ _num_ .
the beef turns out to be $ _num_ .
i personally would not go back , even though the food was fantastic .
treated badly .
the owner gave that table to a local group who showed up after us .
basically , reservations mean nothing here .
even if the food is great , the customer service is terrible .
unfortunately , the party stops there .
the main courses are extremely overpriced ( not unusual for walnut st. ) .
apparently it was a list of people that needed to be seated .
my husband and i left and i said we would n't be coming back .
so extremely rude .
can not justify giving money to someone who runs their business in that manner .
really though someone had to have messed up my dish .
deserts were nothing less than stellar , and the service was awesome .
i was shocked by how bad our experience was considering the other reviews .
the food was decently made and the environment was welcoming .
she said it was salty but the pasta was bland .
she took my bottle of wine and did not mention the price or anything .
most restaurants charge per bottle , not per person .
i may or may not come back .
not off to a good start .
i will not be coming back .
overall not impressed .
so bland .
_num_ stars .
decor leaves much to be desired .
_num_ star .
fifteen minutes later , the waitress returned , but not with our food .
by this time , i was through with this place .
based on my experience , i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
i got the beef , the chicken & cilantro and the spinach empanadas .
do n't get me wrong , i wanted to like this place .
with all that said we tried all _num_ flavors of the empanadas they offered .
i ca n't even understand how people came to that conclusion .
the empty cup is still in front of me though .
i 've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced .
i will never go back though .
not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job .
way too expensive if you ask me .
it is such a rip off .
find someplace else in bloomfield .
is n't that why we bring clothes to the cleaners in the first place ?
they were returned to me a full size smaller than i dropped them off .
not very complicated .
also they lost my fianc 's work shirts .
will not be returning .
it was returned with a hole in back of suit jacket .
sorry to say that will be my last visit .
if someone had been standing there , this would have caused serious injury .
i just ca n't imagine having to deal with this a year .
the minus : the maintenance staff is always around .
their staff is horribly rude that way .
thus , it makes me sad to write a negative review .
they are completely mean and disrespectful .
ps the maintenance staff are fabulous and deserve _num_ stars !
horrible in every sense of the word .
terrible !
it took _num_ months for them to resolve this situation .
at one point , they even asked me not to use the shower .
a year later , the ceiling in my bedroom began to leak .
i used my apartment as essentially a storage unit until my lease expired .
i have never in my life seen anything like it .
they do n't c are .
horrible !
they wo n't even bother to tell you that they will come !
not worth your money .
find a better management who does n't take your money and piss on you .
bathroom leaks atleast _num_ times a month .
very common problem in these apartments .
cant wait to move on .
the rent is too damn high .
if you sign a lease now it 's $ _num_ .
the hallways smell like hot garbage , always .
i was towed within _num_ hours after parking back there at ( 10pm ) .
( no where on the contract does it state that ! )
bingo , could n't have said it better .
it is not worth it .
they just broke into my house without any notice to show around .
then , before i was able to say anything , they broke in .
ridiculous .
i had no disclosure of this whatsoever when i signed my lease .
i do n't even understand how they have the time for this .
it 's absolutely disgusting , and you get no peace whatsoever .
now , i am stuck due to the heavy fees it would cost .
i 'm truly not out to get anyone with writing a negative review .
management did not even apologize for my inconvenience .
i thought this was way too much .
this was my big mistake .
, but instead they decided to take advantage of my position .
i do n't know .
they did not fix the building by the way .
also , my package was stolen twice .
they refuse to put a camera in the package room , parking lot too .
overall the rent keeps going up every year and their service just getting worse .
first of all , and the most important thing , they are not honest .
you pay fees , they make laundry and garbage more and more inconvenient .
elevator always has problems .
they do n't respect your privacy at all .
management said there was nothing they could do about it .
they 're all around rude to deal with .
wondered into this place looking for some mixed drinks .
but too much pamela 's seems greasy .
however , the pricing really is low when you 're lazy .
on top of it all , the coffee was horrible .
it looked like someone 's basement or garage with tables in it .
it 's like breakfast at most any other diner .
if you are dragged here by your friends , find new friends .
two words : grossly overrated .
unfortunately , pamela 's is neither of these things .
sadly , i walked away from my meal with a `` meh '' feeling .
first off , i kept hearing about these pancakes i got ta try .
they were super buttery ... too much so .
too bad .
ca n't beat it .
we had a terrible breakfast here not long ago .
plus the bread was poor quality .
the crepe pancakes were ok , but nothing to write home about .
we 'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future .
for pamela 's , we gave it a shot .
the restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables .
way too rich to finish .
not deserving of the rave reviews .
breakfast is cheap , and definitely very poor quality .
the waitresses were extremely fast , except for coffee refills .
that is a huge turn off , especially if you are out of town .
this place is n't worth going to an atm for .
they are super thin and crispy on the outside .
i also did n't love the service we received .
there are a few of them and there 's really nowhere else to go .
it 's sad .
this was just a joke and definitely not worth the wait .
we went on a sunday and i expected a wait , which was fine .
they were busy , but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around .
this was one of the most disappointing food experiences i 've had in pittsburgh .
it was average , but not restaurant quality .
the only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole .
i ate about _num_ bites and left the rest .
it was n't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste .
needless to say , we wo n't be going back for quite some time !
and , most sadly , the cup of coffee was weak .
not keeping with the the _num_ star yelp review that brought us here .
done in less than _num_ hours .
come now , i barely drink alcohol .
granted , i like to host social events .
however , i never ever will let a social event get out of control .
so here comes the story of walnut capital .
they complained that our house was not clean and scared off the potential tenants .
but we never let the house get to a point of disaster .
we always took the trash out .
never again will i rent from this company .
- chuck the driver for the shuttle is cool .
under no circumstances should you sit down before placing an order .
so , my wife got up and we walked out of this place .
in fact , i did n't eat anything at all .
the restaurant is located in the basement of a building off of walnut street .
first , there are n't many tables .
my party and i left to go to another restaurant .
however , the crepes are extremely over price .
so over price that i can not afford a drink .
i 've chosen never to eat here again due to the staff .
the savory crepes were better than the sweet crepes which were a disappointment .
but it was the attitude of the owner that turned me off the establishment .
we were in a hurry because of limited visiting hours .
the prices on the menu do n't seem that bad .
but i still cant get over the fact there closed on mondays .
that aside , the crepes are okay , nothing special .
the other thing i do not like about this place are their hours .
i looked at my boyfriend who checked his watch while i checked my iphone .
otherwise , negative stars would be in effect .
who on earth could possibly find this place worth returning to ?
what a completely miserable experience .
even the orange juice was bad .
the response and reaction that i got from her receptionist was quite rude .
i made an appointment weeks ago .
i said i could n't .
just totally inconsiderate .
they refuse to put anything on paper .
every thing about this place is wrong .
i should not be responsible for the bill .
they did not explain this to me when i register .
this place is the worst ever .
beware !
when we arrived there , however it was a different story .
we shrugged it off and went to the bar .
terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place .
just getting off work , i came alone .
the walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass .
neither of us were surprised .
the food handling left much to be desired .
this was sorely lacking .
first thing i realized is that there 's no bathroom in the room .
since we were staying one night , this was a major disappointment .
the wedding manager nicole is ok , but nothing special .
it is clear that this is not her main priority .
not professional at all .
not a huge deal , but annoying since we asked them to do that .
unfortunately , it appears to be very poorly managed .
they were not met here .
that is not what you want to hear first thing in the morning !
there were no pictures hung in the room to improve the appearance .
the costumer service really ruined my experience .
awful customer service , rude and poorly managed .
it was not even $ _num_ including se day shipping !
the location also seemed a bit sketchy ; i 'd avoid this one .
try panera bread across the street .
we ai n't got no hashbrowns !
employees show no sense of urgency .
if any of the employees would smile i would die from shock .
do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?
do n't use the drive-thru .
but i quickly learned my lesson .
i got tired of spending _num_ minutes of my lunch break waiting in line .
no less than _num_ minutes .
the drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins .
plus , the staff is rude .
big corporate america places only get one shot w us .
swing and miss .
worst wait times ever , staff is inefficient .
the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly .
also , the service is slow and poor .
worst wendy 's i have ever had .
i suppose , then , i should n't have been surprised by the food .
my moo shu chicken was mostly cabbage .
the food here was greasy , uninspired and bland .
i was also disappointed that they do n't serve brown rice .
not to be recommended unless you 're desperate .
i had to throw it in the microwave because it was no longer hot .
and they gave us some disgusting mustard sauce to dip it in . )
we used to visit this place most every time we went to pittsburgh .
the food is n't terrible , either , but it 's not great .
oh , and the lunch special pricing is not bad at all .
dim lighting that makes me want to sleep .
it 's not romantic , just dim .
the only waitress i 've had there is pretty rude .
my minimum tip is $ _num_ , even at the cheapest places .
the food is only okay .
i am never going to order their general tso ever again .
never ever whatsoever !
price is not bad .
why is it so hard to find a good chinese restaurant in pittsburgh ?
not all her fault .
not bad , a little tasteless , but why bother ?
nor good signs and we should have walked out then .
the worst chinese food i 've had .
there were bugs in my egg drop soup .
i ordered two orders of soup hot and sour and egg drop .
i only eat the hot and sour the night we ordered our take out .
looked like a bunch of fruit flies made their way into the soup .
disgusting .
the wonton soup was watery , and the wontons were inedible .
not very good chinese food here .
it reminded me of a cheap college place .
they give you plenty of food but it is low quality .
the rice tasted like a flavorless mush with chewy `` pork '' .
it tasted nothing like pork , or meat for that matter .
the soup was a weird creamy mess .
wrong .
cardboard .
cardboard with a strange tangy sauce and a side of disaster .
it was just awful and the service was terrible .
i looked around and there were only _num_ other people in the entire restaurant .
is n't that what they 're supposed to do ?
anyway , the food was not very good .
in fact , it was awful .
i 'm not sure they were .
there 's never any reason to be rude to your patrons .
no need to ever return .
after an hour of waiting , i called to check on our order .
i asked if it was out for delivery and she could n't tell me .
she could n't tell me how much longer we would wait .
the delivery driver arrived about _num_ minutes later .
horrible .
crappy service and food .
could not eat it .
waiter clearly did not know what he was talking about .
there are better chinese places on pittsburgh - this place should be shut down !
there is nothing chinese about the food !
general tso chicken lacks in chicken .
terrible service .
our food was cold .
i spent $ _num_ and only ate the fortune cookie .
did n't know you could mess up chicken lo mein .
delivery came somewhat cold , extremely bland .
very disappointed .
the service provided by a chinese man was terrible !
and the food was terrible too !
worst chinese food ever .
it 's either just decent , or just plain bad .
i 'm still trying to figure out how one manages to burn noodles .
this place is disgusting .
worst chinese food i 've ever had .
it tasted rotten and disgusting .
i picked out the broccoli and ate it over my side of rice .
worst chinese food i 've had in ages .
we ordered just soup and eggrolls for takeout .
the worst ever chinese restaurant if we can call this place as restaurant !
future actions : will not come again for sure !
at this point , one star is being generous .
after a noticeable drop in quality , i started ordering elsewhere .
my girlfriend ordered sesame chicken and it tasted like fish .
i had chicken and broccoli with limp foul tasting broccoli .
unfortunately , we threw out most of our entrees .
i will not be ordering here ever again .
i think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside .
_num_ woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable .
i have n't received my piece yet and its been about _num_ days .
everything else was of unremarkable to poor quality .
too pricey for the quality .
while it has a somewhat trendy looking menu , do n't be fooled .
while the onion soup was actually good , the rest was awful .
service was horrible .
very slow .
food was mediocre .
crab cakes were awful .
worse than eat park quality .
just said to try back again !
completely disappointing .
not too shabby .
salads , sandwiches , burgers and entrees we have all had before .
i had the walnut crusted salmon sandwich and jordan had the reuben .
french fries are pretty standard .
the food is lousy .
what a disappointment - i wo n't be back .
the service in this store is ridiculous .
why could n't they take a couple minutes and wrap our gift for us ?
i was so confused and annoyed that i just left after paying .
they just are n't nice .
the manager wears face earrings , how very unprofessional .
sure she knew that rude .
the place is dirty too .
delivery time was unimpressive .
that 's what i get for being lazy , probably .
otherwise , probably not .
man were they wrong !
we ordered a large steak stromboli with extra cheese through grub hub .
not even worth a star .
the hot wings i ordered came as plain breaded wings .
it was one of the worst pizzas i 've ever had .
first of all , the pie had almost no real flavor .
the dough , sauce , cheese ... even the pepperoni was bland .
i put some hot sauce on it strictly to add flavor .
on top of it , i got so sick .
my stomach was in knots for hours .
very cheap over breaded and not fresh at all .
the good : the ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful .
if it were n't so convenient i doubt i 'd go back .
my big issue is that the employees stand directly outside and smoke .
i get the location is close but it is not worth the grief .
i called two more times after this with no call back .
i would n't recommend going here .
there were _num_ customers ahead of me and _num_ ladies behind the counter .
i also plan to tell my family and friends not to shop here .
terrible service .
extremely rude lady works there on sundays .
the worst bakery i ever shopped in !
if given the chance again i would n't have another party here .
very cold to watch a game in even buy usual local rink standards .
made the same mistake 2x by going to these clowns .
could n't even call me to let me know .
drove down there so they could say sorry want to do it tomorrow ?
they 'll try to hit you with a bunch of unnecessary repairs .
do n't waste your time with this place .
just this last episode that has to deal with an inspection has me annoyed !
i have driven _num_ miles in the car since beginning of september .
so after explaining the situation they lower the price to $ _num_ .
not a bad place to look around while waiting for your order .
_num_ which seems to be a never ending construction zone .
the pizza was really greasy , and the bacon was minimal .
avoid .
worst nail salon ever .
not a smart move on my part .
the place was totally dusty and there was no ac .
i just kinda stared at her in shock , unable to speak .
it was just a bad scene .
it 'll never dry !
i would absolutely not return to this salon .
this made me question whether or not she was professionally trained .
what a complete waste .
i had a mani pedi today and they were brutal ... .
so painful !
the owner was sitting right there and did n't do anything or say anything .
please know that i hate leaving bad reviews .
and the pedicure was really really painful !
i would like to stress again though that my feet look awesome .
but i left stressed and bleeding !
i do n't know whats worse , terrible service or this filthy venue .
no wonder it is for sale .
do not get married here !
i would not suggest this bar to anyone .
we went here for easter buffet and the money it was not worth it .
the food was tasteless , place looked dirty , and rude waitress .
this place seems to have gone downhill since last time .
sorry , i gotten very used to no smoking i public places in pittsburgh .
ash trays all over the bar .
if i could give signature desserts _num_ stars , i would .
linda did not call .
this was the worst experience i ever had with business owners !
nothing was the way i ordered it !
i ca n't even begin to tell you how they treated me !
steve and linda were so rude and unprofessional !
just called to get information for my son 's birthday cake .
either way , no need for rudeness .
i bought pastries at this place several times before .
this place is run by korean women who are interested in providing extra services .
$ _num_ wasted because i never got my massage .
avoid this place unless you are looking for the happy ending .
had n't been here for several years , horrible disappointment .
egg rolls , wonton soup were not good .
i visited here at 6:30 p.m. on a saturday night .
there are about _num_ seating options , _num_ were used all the others empty .
first sign i chose to ignore .
nothing updated , nothing new , nothing fresh .
second sign i chose to ignore .
he was loud , very loud .
he was not asian .
white , and very loud .
there was no asian table or house workers in the front side of things .
third sign i chose to ignore .
nothing special in flavor or presentation .
perhaps leftovers from the _num_ steakhouse sale .
i sent all the food back shortly into the meal because it was cold .
when was the last time you ate chinese food that was cold ?
it 's never cold , never .
the tree died .
the salesperson walked away and proceed to start helping other customers .
after waiting for 5-10 minutes , she went back to the sales person .
she paid top dollar for the tree because she believed it was guaranteed .
she received neither .
the service was poor .
unfortunately the food was a let down .
my daughter ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it was quite bland .
the lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude .
will not use this garage in the future .
sounded like i was flying a helicopter .
they just came up with some excuse .
careless workmanship is all you 'll find here .
i had a bad experience at penn automotive .
second , the lady at the counter is extremely rude and unpleasant .
i could have spoken to him in _num_ minutes and gotten out of there .
these folks are not honest and just want you out of there quickly .
have never experience such a rude interaction with a car shop .
this place has gone down hill fast !
the staff makes it feels like you are bothering them when you order .
and _num_ % of the time your order is wrong .
the drive thru is flat out dangerous .
cold food ?
try to avoid this location .
this is nothing new .
this has always been my least favorite wendy 's .
ugh .
the prices are downright insulting .
is that too much to ask ?
for a store the size of giant eagle , i expect more .
third , i 've personally had issues with meat quality here .
the first time , i thought maybe i just got a bad batch .
fool me -- you ca n't get fooled again . ''
lastly , i 've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location .
it 's annoying , i get it .
but my hubby did n't know any better .
but kayla , our cashier ?
completely unacceptable !
all right , now i 'm really done .
i 've eaten here several times and they are not very flexible .
they did n't .
they gave me another burnt sandwich .
worst customer service ever at the pharmacy here .
ridiculous .
avoid at all costs -- inefficient beyond belief .
i will not be back .
tonight is the last time i use this giant eagle pharmacy .
these people are the worst .
i get there only to find out they have nothing ready .
from there , it takes them another _num_ minutes to fill one prescription .
thank you for wasting my time , i wo n't be back .
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
why every time i come in here , it 's really hot ?
better than subway , but not jimmy johns .
this place does not accept credit cards in the year _num_ .
overall just a really bad experience .
not sure about the food handling practices here .
tasted very good , but i was disappointed in how dirty this place is .
very rude staff .
i heard her talking about customers very badly .
i do n't mind them being cash only .
i do n't mind the unpleasant cashiers .
i 'm begging you .
i would n't wish this place on my own worst enemy .
i would n't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend .
he was very kind , but only dropped my food off .
the menu says there 's a charge for fried rice instead of white .
jimmy wan 's offers white and brown , no extra charge .
the atmosphere was atrocious .
the waitstaff saw what was happening and did n't care at all .
how were _num_ people in the _num_ seat restaurant and one small takeout order .
wan 's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with _num_ other friends .
he called me to pick him up as i was paying the bill .
the rest of the food was awful .
it was actually so bad that we asked to talk to the manager .
they were again completely flavorless , but warmer .
i could n't taste salt or pepper or garlic or even feel any heat .
it was awful .
i hated this food and this experience .
the staff was rude .
i closed the door and she walked away .
that was insanely rude .
this place is just not what it used to be .
this is the worst chinese food i 've ever had in pittsburgh .
honestly , it 's probably the worst i 've ever had .
i expected at least decent and i was extremely disappointed .
this place barely uses any flavor other than salt and msg .
unfortunately i heard after i ordered .
we were so excited to try this after all the hype .
last night we ordered take out and it left us disappointed .
mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry .
i 'm just not that excited for my lunch .
there 's not much left to say .
got chicken with string beans ( $ _num_ ) take-out .
the chicken was slimy and not many pieces at that .
this dish was smothered in sauce and had no flavor .
i will not order anything from this place ever again .
go to sesame inn in north hills and other locations .
i 'm not sure its all made in-house anymore .
moo shu has plenty of cabbage , hardly any meat .
paid $ _num_ for three early bird specials - all three were beef broccoli .
food is adequate but service leaves something to be desired .
after a lengthy wait we ended up sitting at separate tables .
delivery was fast but the food was terrible !
the egg roll was soggy and cold .
also , very expensive !
total for the above was $ _num_ !
hand me my order and cash me out ! )
we ordered spider sushi rolls , hawaiian chicken , and general tso chicken .
unfortunately the atmosphere did n't make up for the sub par food .
i 've had way better chinese sushi at giant eagle of all places .
it turned into a giant mess .
not sure we will be back .
i was sick to my stomach when i left .
the one rabbit is ( per statement vet ) not going to get better .
yet , he still drew blood and several yelled codes to the techs .
money trouble ?
because i 'm not prepared to pay $ _num_ for a single visit ?
my cat is not eating .
thanks , but no .
replied `` uh , it has to be printed '' .
actually , there are not `` two sizes '' of `` one scoop '' .
pretty disappointed in my service here the other day .
_num_ minutes of discussion for $ _num_ worth of food ?
so rude .
but my patience was not even worth it .
somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review .
upon arriving i immediately did n't feel welcome .
it tasted like hot chocolate .
things like that really bother me .
bottom line : not terrible , but very underwhelmed by the coffee and service .
this place is dirty and the coffee is horrible .
ok i said i was sorry .
number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable .
first and far most people , i never write a bad review .
actually , this is n't even a bad review .
the pad thai was not good and that 's what it should be !
i do n't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall .
just not going back there .
who cares what i think though , everyone has a different taste .
i have n't been here in a long time .
i should 've known better .
the waitress just was too young and inexperienced .
this visit was n't horrible , but definitely kinda unpleasant .
( seriously , i feel sorry for someone truly fat going in there ) .
um , not me , thanks .
truly , if at all possible , avoid her !
i 'm nothing if not organized .
but i already had a bad taste in my mouth .
it 's really too bad because as i said , her collection looks lovely .
but for those considering a long distance purchase , just beware a bit .
worst venue iv been to .
big mistake .
but it was n't during peak hours .
as noted by other posters the waitress was the bartender .
smoky , but not horribly so .
not sure why it would be featured on the show .
i get the same meal constantly and pay different prices everytime .
owner is rude & does n't handle customers well .
i will never place an order for me & my coworkers again .
terrible service , rude staff .
avoid this place .
while it was ok , it was n't great .
i wo n't be back .
ordered a glass of wine and beers for my companions .
sent one of my companions to get me some water .
they were frozen and certainly not worth the price .
the garbage and mail are very inconvenient .
it is just way too expensive to live like in a trailer park .
this place is terrible .
i am giving it _num_ stars only because the manager was nice .
the food was even worse than i remembered .
it was so spicy i could n't really taste anything .
and it was very annoying !
she did n't refill drinks .
the food was lukewarm when it arrived at the table .
my salad was missing _num_ items that were supposed to be on the salad .
not very appetizing .
asked for a manager , she never came to the table .
bad night ?
not sure and we wo n't be back to find out .
like two weeks ago when i stayed here for three days ?
you get off the elevator on the 5th floor .
bathrooms way too small i had to dry off outside the bathroom .
they really are the only thing this place has going for it .
luckily , it was n't an issue for me to move .
not so great ?
the hotel subs out the services for the business office .
not a good idea .
one of the people working said that was probably because of `` renovations . ''
the elevator moved really slow .
i think they probably deserve better .
the restaurant was worse for breakfast .
there were tables and servers ?
bad planning and execution ?
this school is a terrible deal for what you pay .
i do not support this unethical business practice .
i would give carolina auto repair no stars if possible .
i can not eat salad so ordered the soup .
turns out they do n't have soup .
turns out they do n't have mixed vegetables which is on the menu .
so instead of the rice i ordered a baked potato .
we got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter .
do n't waste your time or money .
my salad had a rotten tomato and a hair ( not mine ) .
the broiled flounder was n't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies .
both were so bland i could have prepared a better version at home .
my mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre .
i 'm sure they do but i had to spit mine out .
this particular location is horrible .
avoid !
avoid !
after _num_ minutes without getting closer to the register , i gave up .
this used to be my favorite local waffle house .
i walked in and was a little surprised .
_num_ separate different roaches in a matter of _num_ minutes in the same restaurant .
i will never be back .
the front waiting area was in mass confusion .
this is not an acceptable response for management .
this pizza hut is not a top choice , but ok in a pinch .
i had my _num_ year old with me and i 'm _num_ weeks pregnant .
we were starving waiting on our food .
another _num_ minutes pass and we finally got our order .
i live _num_ minutes from their location .
service was horrible !
not to mention , our order was wrong !
avoid at all costs ... .
this place is way over priced .
fired oysters and scallops over $ _num_ here .
if you use a teller you get charged $ _num_ for the month .
the food was awful .
but they do n't even seem to have subs .
tables were dirty .
well ok i guess .
the building is old and dirty .
never going back .
not one good thing to say .
so our entire meal that day ended up in the trash .
i was n't able to find the _num_ lb .
ball within the already limited selection .
food is limited and all fried , that 's not a good thing either .
i only give it _num_ stars because of the wait staff !
it is ridiculous !
they need to find new wait staff who are attentive and friendly !
does zero good to complain .
obvious they could care less .
worst mcdonalds in the united states of america .
i could get food faster in a prison cell .
most fast food places fall in the the meh category for me .
the employees did not seem to care and had no sense to work faster .
avoid !
and a lot has changed for the worst unfortunately .
horrible !
not to mention they do n't fill your drink !
the gun shot great , unfortunately the staff and facilities were well below par .
i have spent a lot of time at shooting ranges both indoors and out .
i will not be a repeat patron .
he warned me about this place ... should have taken his advice .
rude , disrespectful jerks who should not be dealing with the public .
like i said , i wo n't be back .
we did n't , as this was our first visit .
the range itself had terrible ventilation .
sweating at the lanes while trying to hold a loaded gun .
no bueno .
the lighting was poor .
my biggest complaint is pricing .
$ _num_ per hour per person ... with an one hour minimum .
most indoor ranges charge by lane , not person .
customer service was poor and unfriendly .
the bathroom was gross .
they will not get another dime of mine .
same guy , same attitude .
if you 're desperate for chinese , get it to go .
went a few times and the last visit made me sick .
i was very disappointed with new china .
we got the curry chicken , beef with broccoli , and crab rangoons .
i would highly encourage others to go elsewhere .
i will not return to new china .
the staff is rude and store is usually very dirty .
get your wallet ready , the prices are crazy high !
nothing to brag about .
but last night it took _num_ hrs to get a burger .
management did n't even come by table to apologize about the wait .
here for trivia night on tuesday night .
good food but this is ridiculous .
they need to get some help in here or people will stop coming !
the hollandaise sauce was sour and had a horrible vinegar taste to it .
just had the worst experience at a nail salon .
so i did n't pay for the white .
absolute worst experience at a nail salon .
my acrylics now look like crap , and i have cuts on my cuticles .
my friend 's nails looked like a _num_ year old did them .
this was the worst gel manicure experience i 've had .
all the techs are nice except the man ( andy ) he is horrible !
he can not get the shape right to save his life .
my acrylic nails are crooked and shorter than i asked .
on top of that he is very rude and has no customer service skills .
i have left bleeding twice .
the staff 's attitude is straight out of the big apple .
we did n't have a problem taking it to go .
would n't recommend going out of your way for a slice .
what happened ?
hoping it 's just been a bad few nights .
but last few times i have gone it has not taste the same .
crust not cooked enough etc i hope this is not a trend .
parking is atrocious .
however i was n't treated well and i wo n't go back .
just awful customer service .
we were disappointed .
firstly , this place used to be free to the public .
but this was our first visit , and we wo n't be back .
it looked like they had not worked on this field in many months .
also had to dodge many foul balls .
okay , so maybe that night we just had bad luck ?
our greeting at the front desk was awful .
she was appalling and rude .
another $ _num_ .
very sad that there are people out there taking advantage of per owners .
this is on a weekend ( saturday night - sunday morning ) .
as a customer i really do n't care .
i 'm glad this place is for emergency service only ( for us ) .
when the tech returned with my dog she did n't say a word .
alot of money for very poor care .
i will not be going back .
this pizza is mediocre at best .
no thank you .
i got a medium _num_ topping and this pizza was very bland to me .
from my first bite it was missing something ... flavor .
wo n't be going back .
the pizza is very soggy and the salad is brown and mostly inedible .
they ripped me off .
i paid over $ _num_ for _num_ large cheese pizzas .
they do n't even have a restroom for customers !
this is the burger king that corporate forgot .
king nasty !
just awful .
the last time that we went there he had our car for over week .
we called again and he said that they could n't find our car keys .
i have n't use their service yet .
i stopped by to see them , asking them to give me a price .
i gave them all my contacts information to reach me .
they seems not care to lose a customer , it is disappointing .
no return call either .
do n't bother .
i wish i could give less stars .
i told her that was no problem .
she not only lost out on a past customer .
owner on the phone and did n't even acknowledge the customer .
food was awful .
szechuan beef tasted like ketchup .
it is too bad i ca n't give this zero stars .
i had kung pao chicken and got really bad food poisoning .
the chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful .
food was terrible and woman who rang me up was soooooo rude .
chicken chewy and rubbery .
last two years have noticed quality of food sadly going down .
couple of years ago more orders were found to be overcooked and less meaty .
i brought my order home , found three pieces of chicken , overcooked .
sorry panda ; this loyal customer has had enough .
it was indeed pretty horrible even for $ _num_ per medium .
do not go for the pumpkin patch !
it 's really sad actually .
the installers were knowledgeable , friendly and efficient .
my main issue is that i did not receive what i paid for .
very poor customer service , and that 's too bad .
so frustrated .
i just do n't know how a business in _num_ can operate this way .
them stood behind some policy that they could n't sell parts .
they came out on a sunday which is much appreciated .
one week later it was empty again .
i wasted $ _num_ for nothing because they did n't do a through job .
i booked this hotel stay for a business ( military ) event .
we booked a total of _num_ rooms with them and checked in individually .
i was a little dissatisfied in how poorly i welcomed to the hotel .
the cable and internet did not work our first night there .
the room had a musty smell to it .
it was not superior by any means but very nice for the average express .
the parking situation is horrible .
she did not greet me as i opened the door .
she did , however , return quickly with a hair dryer .
most of the staff were borderline rude or down right rude .
the breakfast area was incredibly crowded .
the morning of checkout my bill had not been placed under the door .
worst service in the area , by far .
i have eaten at this restaurant before and the service was n't so bad .
food was ok , nothing much to speak of .
he said that he could not take it and referred me to the manager .
they said if i printed it out , i could have used it .
he did not understand and said , no coupon .
none of the regulars were there .
do n't waste your time coming to this hole in the wall !
made me walk across the floor after my pedi w bare feet .
i looked down and saw dirty toe nails and finger nails on the floor .
gross !
worse nail salon i 've ever experienced .
nails looked nice but only lasted about _num_ and a half days .
no heavy lifting no reason for my nails to be breaking left and right .
do not waste your time or money there , you will regret it .
unfortunately , that did n't happen .
when i walked in i gave them my name and paid for my order .
but then i had to wait more than _num_ minutes to get my food .
unacceptable .
if i had not already paid for the food , i would have left .
my sandwich did n't even have true tomato slices .
just chunks of tomato .
this was such a sour experience .
i wo n't be back .
we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries .
save your money on the chili cheese fries .
and cheese sauce that you get for your nachos at the gas station .
i have been here a total of four times .
sure enough , a few minutes later it was on my table .
the portions here are huge ( the one constant ) .
next week i happily tried to repeat the last order i got .
ended up just getting plain strips with honey mustard on the side .
drinks are far too expensive to try any .
the wings and cheese fries were disgusting .
do n't recommend buying a car of another make here .
only after the third time returning did anyone apologize .
so fool me once , shame on me .
i consider it a blessing that it did n't work out .
very rude service was in line for ten mins .
most places charge _num_ to _num_ dollars .
i thought it was from a sloppy oil change .
so much for trying to support local business .
it 's not .
holly on the way to _num_ .
every order is wrong .
too bad even then the orders are not right .
what 's worse ?
nothing changes even when they are n't busy .
avoid this location .
most time i wait so long i end up going inside .
the cheapest thing on the menu was $ _num_ .
when it was time to get up the breakfast food was bad .
they charge for internet service in the room , that 's so _num_ !
but it 's not good for longer stays or repeat visits .
half of the floors do n't have vending machines .
one of the floors that does does not offer drinks .
internet access is $ _num_ per day .
it 's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable .
answer : pretty bad !
it was a tired person 's worst nightmare .
i 'd say , skip this one .
we booked this hotel to stay during an overnight layover in charlotte .
that 's just nasty !
so i went through the whole thing for nothing .
there are no decent food options within walking distance .
the beds are very comfortable so you can get a good night 's sleep .
however , as a guest , i would not go back .
she did n't offer any ideas for help and was quite frankly , rude .
i had the same problem on my laptop , ipad and iphone .
it was n't me .
others in our group had problems as well .
not convenient for an early flight .
this hotel is really dated , and the rooms smell funny .
night manager tried to enter my room at _num_ am while i was sleeping .
my sleep and stay was ruined .
i 've contacted the hotel manager twice and have received no response from her .
the hotel itself is ok .
the bed was comfortable enough and the room was mostly clean .
it looks like they do n't vacuum very often .
the room i had was bland , one piece of ugly artwork .
open closet reminiscent of a motel _num_ .
it was clean , but nothing to note otherwise .
she was told that they only have one cart !
this is a pretty big hotel , so that is ridiculous .
we simply ordered _num_ bagels , coffee and tea for breakfast .
oh yeah , the ac sounds like a _num_ taking off above your bed .
i 'm sure you can find better accommodations in this price range and location .
there is nothing to eat within walking distance .
not delivering .
i do n't need to spend my money there .
could n't do that !
im never going back .
delivery was good for a salad but for everything else i was sadly disappointed .
no this was just gross .
my noodles were cold ... like really cold .
i will say it was cheap and the spring roll was edible .
service was terrible !
i am disappointed the table i was most concerned about is horrible .
avoid at all costs !
upon receipt she told the manager she could n't see clearly .
the doctor confirmed her prescription was accurate and the glasses were off .
do not shop here , it 's not worth the risk .
they are so rude do n't waste your time here .
i made a change in frames less than _num_ hours from original order .
was told there would be no problem .
mine were n't made because they had the wrong size lens .
this store is terrible .
took _num_ days to pick up the cut sofa !
they were then _num_ hours late picking it up !
terrible .
assistant manager says he had no way to contact delivery people for assistance .
please save your money and visit another store or company .
terrible .
it took _num_ 1/2 months for my office furniture to arrive .
in the mean time my sales rep was fired apparently .
this is not what you promised to sell me .
gag !
the clerk said she was sorry .
garden ridge is not the same ... it has really gone downhill .
their shopping carts are all rusty and broken .
i miss the old garden ridge .
is it me or have the prices at garden ridge gotten ridiculously high ?
no wonder the store was empty .
i called garden ridge to speak to a customer service rep .
gave me a texas number .
too much trouble .
too many other competent companies to model after .
im _num_ from ohio .
i shop alot , sometimes too much .
not very impressed with my last two trips here .
they ended up calling two more over , but it took way too long .
but you know what words i do n't mind hearing ?
`` unfortunately we do n't have that information . ''
`` apologies for the mistake .
that 's not our usual practice . ''
i 've visited this store _num_ times .
only _num_ times .
first time nothing unusual happened .
i walked around .
i 'm not asking too much .
shes says , `` they 're not '' .
no sorry or who told you this .
smh ... customer service is clearly not on their priority list .
i guess it does n't have to be .
they know they 're going to get customers in regardless .
i 'll limit my visits until i find that treasure .
although i love the store , this store has horrible customer service .
breakfast was good .
was checking in and they completely lied to me about having a separate room .
i could not believe how filthy this store was .
the employees could have cared less as well .
so disappointed .
most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something .
i went back to the counter to find a different manager .
after going through each bag , i could not find the correct band .
thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch .
i wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area .
they are apparently saying i cant cancel a custom order .
am i still expected to keep waiting ?
these people are very difficult to do business with .
will take my money elsewhere .
if they say yes , the bread is likely to be eaten .
btw , we did n't have an inexpensive lunch .
if not , then go .
i dunno .
horrible .
as another reviewer said it was set up weird .
should try ordering from the menu it might be better .
i was disappointed with the selection of food as well .
my husband let me try a bite of his rueben which was really good .
first off , the beer menu .
ultimately , i was n't very impressed .
i just did n't want to create a scene in front of my guest .
i was expecting something stellar , and i feel rather let down .
this stuff looked and tasted more like doughy noodles .
it was tasteless , and the fruit center was nothing more than filler .
we ca n't believe it .
we can not , therefore , understand the rave reviews .
to each his own , i guess .
the waitstaff are very unprofessional all standing around and talking loud near your table .
i drove _num_ minutes for overpriced `` german '' food .
i will not be coming back at all .
no thanks .
that is the most ridiculous thing i 've ever heard .
it is definitely not _num_ days free with no questioned asked .
slowest deli department in town .
i was unable to justify spending $ _num_ or $ _num_ for their membership .
was also told i get free $ _num_ gift certificate at restaurant.com .
i try calling bj 's and wait over _num_ minutes on hold .
no offer to adjust my membership so i ask for $ _num_ refund .
_num_ weeks and so far no refund has hit my account .
the food was not prepared well .
the baked potato was awful and the service was mediocre .
this has only been my 2nd time at a red lobster ever .
i have had better seafood elsewhere .
we were seated quickly for a friday night and the server was fine .
the seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter .
red lobster was not the place to be tonight .
the service was horrible .
it seem to be over before it started .
_num_ minutes later , she finally brought it back for me to sign .
never received a refill on my soda .
terribly ran !
food takes forever and it does n't come out right .
the wait staff is slow and management has no clue .
but rather good could n't complain .
it does n't !
the only good thing was that the cheese biscuits here are bomb !
everything else is a joke .
i 'm not big on chain restaurants .
not because the food is bad but because i like to try new places .
i see why this restaurant is rated so poorly .
the clientele , for some reason , really made for a loud dining experience .
our waitress was hit or miss and we waited awhile for the bill .
would not visit again .
worst service i have ever had .
the waitress the first time i went was a little short , not personable .
the second time about 2-3 months later was just awful .
i was there on a weeknight , for over _num_ hours .
i just do n't even know what to say .
it made my whole experience disappointing .
i wo n't go back to this location .
our salad and bread came out with our food which was a little irritating .
he was great but everything else was extremely slow .
i really ca n't imagine what could be making it so slow here .
just got back from dinner which took over _num_ hrs .
i hate to blame the kitchen , but i think it 's the kitchen .
plus my caesar salad had slimy wilted lettuce .
food was mediocre as well .
wo n't be coming back .
boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store .
the store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care .
terrible service .
the message to me is management must be blind & ignorant .
the store would not cash out the remaining balance on the gift cards .
this place sucks big time as far as cleanliness and order .
are they going out of business ?
i made a very simple order online -- very difficult to screw up .
huge disappointment .
the sub was not one bit better than subway .
this was a complete waste of my time and money .
my bill : $ _num_ .
no complaints there .
the to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho .
um no , its like $ _num_ extra for delivery .
not cool .
my advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same .
the restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly .
wo n't visit again .
waiting in line took roughly _num_ minutes on a tuesday about _num_ noon .
i asked for an estimated wait time , not how many appointments there are .
bad business practices are very disappointing .
that is not a way to earn anyone 's business !
just gon na stand here and get looked over for a little while longer .
decent furniture but wow was i disappointed by the payment process .
why is n't this practice illegal ?
it 's sad to experience systems that work so obviously against the customer .
he just put it on the bill .
worst customer service ever !
ashley furniture will get my business from now on .
at first they said they are unable to do so .
the quality of the furniture turned out to be very poor .
the store told them that they have problems with that manufacturer all the .
to date the store has done nothing to replace the defective furniture .
the worst customer service ever !
they already had my money , so why be courteous now ?
that 's is bad business !
she was super excited and counting down the days until arrival .
they have completely horrible , rude customer service reps .
tried to call corporate and let 's just say they could care less .
thinking back and forth on it did n't seem right .
i was ok with this and it sounded fair enough .
well i went there on january _num_ to return my mattress .
did not want to buy another mattress online .
most places allow return of items within _num_ days , even if a mattress .
it was awful !
this is by far the absolute worst furniture experience i have encountered .
the sales lady made an annoying appearance every ten minutes .
at this point , my patience are very thin .
i mean really , this is ridiculous .
my god the sun will be coming up soon !
that was unacceptable .
the main waiting area is also empty .
they next wanted to try my hands and i refused .
i will never have another mri done there .
the baby starts coming out : doctors runs in my room .
terrible treatment .
if you have an emergency do not come here .
go here to die !
i went here after a car accident that was not my fault .
and i felt like total crap the whole next day at work .
they gave me my cast and i left at _num_ .
i can not be refunded and the bill will be sent .
self checkout is the only option and is a joke .
employees would much rather carry inappropriate conversations for the work place than assist .
sorry wo n't be back !
if no stars could be given that would be more accurate .
this store , however , is definitely lacking in customer service .
no way , no how .
we left , went to the charlotte store and they were amazing .
i called back at 10am instead .
some rude nasty woman answers the phone !
next time your country ass needs to stay home from work .
the person checking me out was not hospitable .
went here and of course had the worst experience getting my bridesmaid dress .
stick to a boutique if you want real customer service .
she did n't say a word to us .
they had _num_ opportunities to assist us with the process and ignored us .
they could n't find it in the `` on holds area '' wth ?
we felt bad , and stuck around .
bad idea .
there is _num_ minutes left to pick and try on dresses !
lost sale opportunity .
a very frustrating moment indeed .
the other staff were horrible !
another lost sale opportunity .
they lost out big time with me .
i open the bag where my dress was and i was so dissapointed .
my problem is with the alterations department .
they also rushed me during my final fitting .
very rude and unprofessional , do n't go there !
brandy was the worst .
if she 's the best , i would hate to see the worst .
do not get your alterations done at this location !
they charge at least $ _num_ more for bridesmaids alteration of a short dress .
the hem was n't even touched and they charged me $ _num_ .
they lack skills .
$ _num_ ?
this whole department is insane .
glad this is all over .
this store is not customer service friendly .
that should have been my first clue to walk away .
so i asked how to return it and he did n't know .
my real complaint is just how rudely we were treated at both locations .
worst service i 've had in a long time .
it was just me and my mom and i just wanted to browse .
so that was weird .
what a horrible experience !
i also came in many times before and the employees never helped me .
they were just sitting down doing nothing .
i am definitely disappointed .
i would n't even give them one star at this location !
this was the worst service and experience i have ever received !
the ladies at the reception desk are horrible !
i called to order contacts and they were utterly confused .
terrible place and i would not recommend this facility to anyone .
i said to myself , this is unsanitary practices being used here .
i asked for a full refund , i was not spending my money here .
this restaurant is so gross and it 's dirty .
but this location puts the name to shame .
are you kidding me - not even inspected prior to delivery .
poor attention to detail , poor quality .
poor follow up .
the guy was obviously knowledgable about mattresses but he was rude and condescending .
tried to pressure me into buying a bed right then and there .
neither of us were impressed .
so if this was based on food i would give buca a _num_ .
two and a half stars , neither a-ok nor real bad .
the lunch portion was huge , too much in fact .
service was absolutely dismal for no good reason .
it was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch .
it was loud and crowded .
needless to say ... i will never go there again !
every time we have eaten here , we were hungry shortly after .
very dim lighting somewhere between romantic and creepy .
it is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food .
at least with this experience , did not have the best server .
he did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job .
no hurry to go back there ... ever .
i do n't know if i can ever return to buca .
firstly , i knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived .
she just seemed ... off ... or high .
ok , i did , and i stopped eating .
there is nothing worse than someone else 's hair in your food .
so , i kept quiet against my better judgement .
confused !
i just started laughing , i was sure this entire night was a joke .
holy ... cannoli ... get me out of here !
sorry buca , a previous visit was much better than this one .
so disappointed !
you really seem to care about this restaurant 's reputation .
he said they 're making improvements and that i should try it again .
i was n't as impressed with buca as i wanted to be .
the only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage .
it was just okay as a whole .
for our main dish , we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni .
it just was n't as authentic as i was hoping for .
they had _num_ hostess up front doing nothing and did n't even greet us .
why would you even try to seat us like that ?
reason i book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time .
she gave me an attitude .
terrible customer service and it was my birthday .
disappointment .
will never return to the restaurant .
disgusting !
worst italian food ever !
they should n't even call it italian food .
the bread was even bad .
do n't waste your time and money going here .
i was less than impressed .
the meatballs were greasy and very bland .
the price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive .
seriously , how many f words can you not use on a yelp review ?
salad came first then bruschetta ( wtf ) toast and tomatoes and cheese .
came out fast , but entre 's came out _num_ mins later .
it was n't bad , just nothing great .
its like the place tries too hard .
as if the food is not the real star of the show .
my server lost me towards the end .
instead it 's a runny broth at the bottom of the bowl .
once again we leave this place unhappy and dissatisfied .
this food is just crap .
i made sure i asked for extra sauce ( just in case ) .
needless to say i was disappointed again !
terrible !
it was also barely cooked , not crispy at all .
what a disappointment !
the fist time after a _num_ minute wait , they brought the wrong food .
they gave us a $ _num_ gift card to make up for it .
avoid !
worst customer service .
staff very rude .
never had problem at other locations .
will not return at this location !
mama ricotta will be a better option .
management very rude and customer service is very poor .
yes , that 's not long , but it 's definitely boring .
i do n't like this place , nor the food .
strange odor - musty old smell .
other table was trying to check out and the bartender and manager ( ? )
very noisy .
but a $ _num_ dinner for _num_ i expect more .
birthday celebration & dessert is n't free ?
service was sub par at best .
last nights visit to buca was less than i expect from this restaurant .
the service was awful .
we were very disappointed .
$ _num_ bill for four -- sorry i expect much better service !
the drinks and salads are also soooo pricey .
nothing special .
the visit i am reviewing was for take-out .
nearly _num_ minutes after that time , my order was still not ready .
it appears this location has a serious management issue .
it more than less ruined our dining experience .
this was a very disappointing dining experience .
we ordered _num_ family portions of _num_ different dishes .
the spaghetti and meatballs were very bland .
the only dish we liked was the chicken dish .
completely ruined our meal .
so this past friday i held a birthday dinner for my mother here .
things quickly got off to a bad start .
the staff would not know i had once asked for that room .
however , i will never return to this place .
ok italian food , portions are big , but you pay for them .
service was ok , birthday dessert was a bowl of whipped cream .
when i walked in and looked over the menu i too was excited .
unfortunately the food did not come close to my expectations .
baked ziti is supposed to have a lot of cheese and sauce .
is n't that what baked ziti is ?
and the veal was dry .
not good customer service .
unless you have no other choice do not shop here .
the store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then harris teeter .
this place sucks the cashiers are either very rude , slow and incompetent .
unfortunately , the service is some of the worst i 've experienced in charlotte .
they all looked at me , none greeted or walked toward me .
none of the three ever tried to assist .
false advertising on patio furniture .
overall , the look of the store just seems to be tired .
never will be coming back here again .
worst customer service ever !
seriously i waited in the drive thru for like _num_ minutes .
( i was _num_ cars away ) .
i 'm stuck between two and three stars .
after all it is taco bell .
you can usually count on them for cheap and fast food .
the cheap part is always standard .
but , the fast part for this location has struggled for a while .
although , i do really have zero complaints on the food .
after all it is taco bell .
excuse given was understaffed but when you are not busy it does n't fly .
what an ordeal !
despite the cost of the set we had to pay $ _num_ for delivery .
or , they can pick-up the entire set and provide _num_ % credit .
no consideration to the value of our time .
the hostess was very short with me and my date .
no personality and did n't make us feel welcome .
no personality , still .
my date did n't like her steak either .
things have really slipped since then though .
they drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese ... .
my soup was alright - french onion - pretty standard .
we like longhorn , but not this location .
the service here is mediocre at best .
when we eventually got the appetizer the bread , there were no plates around .
_num_ more minutes to get plates .
my caesar salad was sour and otherwise bland .
worst experience in a long time .
our waitress did not seem very enthusiastic .
no such luck .
the only employee i could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender !
from the other reviews it seems i did n't miss anything .
this used to be my favorite steak house in charlotte .
it 's really gone downhill lately .
the last _num_ times i 've eaten here the prime rib was still cold .
he brought it back still cold .
they get two for the great service but everything else was not so good .
her corn on the cob was undercooked .
we will not be coming back again .
probably why ... carlos the manager is cheap and not customer friendly !
our server jeff was the worst waitstaff i 've encountered in many years .
that he did n't know there was a problem ?
that he had been there _num_ months and never had a complaint ?
i wish i would have taken a picture .
i could n't believe they tried to pass that off as a steak .
it 's not a very good longhorn .
my hubby ordered coffee , cobb salad and filet .
no complaints .
his salad had no issues so all in all it was what we expected .
our expectations were not too high and the restaurant delivered just that .
it 's not .
i would not recommend going to this best buy location .
then customer service wouldnt help me .
after waiting another five to ten minutes someone finally came .
no thank you or thanks for you patience .
he put the tv in my truck turned around and walked away .
absolutely horrible customer service !
the worst best buy i have ever visited .
back and forth a total waste of time .
then the manager told me we would not have sold one in the condition .
but they sure sold it to me .
horrible service .
horrible customer service .
only _num_ people in line when arrived .
_num_ minutes later _num_ people still in line .
ridiculous !
horrible is the word .
horrible business practice here .
do not shop at best buy .
they 'll gladly take your money , however , good luck getting issues resolved .
there was a long line and only one employee at the checkout .
they have no clue what the word `` toasted '' means .
the lox bagels are not even made open face .
not going back again .
i got back to my office and the bagel was not toasted .
not the best or the worst mall in charlotte .
they would n't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down .
i will not be back to see year people again !
gave this mall yet another try again today , disappointed again .
all the regular stores , plus some of the more trashy ones .
which on the mall alone would be _num_ star !
this was the worst customer service i have encountered in awhile .
nothing !
i went to exchange a product , instead i just returned .
i chose the fiesta chicken chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup .
the chicken tortilla soup was just ok .
overall , the experience was horrible .
the service was horrible .
so if you 're coming to drink ... not so bad .
if you 're coming to eat ... ah you might think again !
i was disgusted .
yes i know sometimes things could land i 'm my food .
she then went to get our drinks .
very visible and inappropriate .
i wish i could give a no star review for this location .
the only bright spot was the waitress .
the runny quinoa was a mess and hard to boot .
the pasta at applebee 's are definitely not worth the $ _num_ they charge .
the portions are way too small and not good at all .
we went here with family to have lunch , the service was ok .
that was not to be found here .
the food sucked .
just a mess .
total mess .
please do not use this location .
they do not take responsibility for their mistakes .
it 's a shame , because it was a beautiful gift .
do not do business with these people .
shortly after , another lady comes over .
clearly , i was never meant to know the price of this ring .
the same style etc , just a different ring that fit .
just a bit uncomfortable to see how much someone spent on an engagement ring !
i was very unimpressed with this olive garden location .
secondly , the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company .
anyways , horrible experience .
the table they sat us at , smelled so badly !
i did not even want to put my purse down .
this made my food experience not good .
the place is just older and needs some renovations .
the place is not clean , the table we sat was sticky .
the deal also comes with either a small app or a dessert to share .
the spicy sausage soup she first ordered was mostly broth .
want a zero star option !
i am a fan of olive garden but this one is horrible !
ended up with _num_ meals un eaten .
we got there around _num_ and had no wait for a table .
breadsticks and salad came out like expected .
the breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more .
he ate it and did n't complain ... .
this is probably one of the worst olive garden i have been to .
my server was horrific .
i am completely disappointed .
she and i were both a little nervous about getting poor service .
he said , `` no , absolutely not .
throughout the entire order , we got nothing but attitude .
but the rest of the place , not so much .
could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink ?
otherwise , it would have been pretty good .
i know , i know -- olive garden , how pedestrian of me !
when we sat down , i was immediately hit by a gross smell .
it smelled badly like wet dog .
how disgusting .
the bread sticks were pretty underwhelming -- there was no garlic or flavor really .
they served salad shortly my goodness this place was slow though .
when it came out , it was pretty lousy .
i 'd stay away from this garden like the plague , though .
i feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something .
this place was disgusting !
the food was gross , greasy and very bad .
i gave it one star because of the waiter .
smells like wet dog .
service was very bad today .
delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking !
the service however , left much to be desired .
our server was obviously having a bad night .
it took almost _num_ minutes to get our salad .
at that point our drinks were empty .
poor service .
service is very bad .
waitress was throwing plates on the table .
have been to many restaurants but this was my worst experience .
wow , only in charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl .
it 's og though , so neither were anything spectacular .
it saved me from cooking and doing dishes though .
we wo n't be stopping back to celebrate at this location again .
food came slow and was cold .
but the reason i went was to try the lobster raviolis .
there i was very disappointed .
shrimp on top was nice but no lobster filling .
i just remembered why i do n't visit chain sit down restaurants .
i 'm glad there was more mango than strawberry .
the strawberry was too sweet .
by far the worst service we 've had in a while .
i am a big fan of olive garden but not this one .
a refill was never offered .
the salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light .
it was totally different from all other og restaurants i 've visited .
i doubt that i 'll ever go back to this location again .
no one was at the door to greet me .
i had to walk around the whole restaurant to find my husband .
what a terrible manager !
i see the server standing right there with no response .
slow service and a mediocre meal .
for example , at my most recent visit i ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo .
the steak was supposed to be medium ; instead it came well done .
( that might also explain the meat being overdone ) .
very disappointing .
i do n't like chains a lot , but some i tolerate .
it 's noisy , crowded , disorganized , and there are not enough waiters .
so far really slow food service .
okay , but wo n't be going back soon .
saturday was my first time back and i was dissapointed in the changes .
otherwise i would have brought him with me and we could have dined in !
really made me sad .
its not like she got nothing out of it !
the fries were bad .
not crispy but chewy and not very salty .
does n't seem like good customer service .
never again will i deal with these useless morons .
first mistake .
this was a no go for me .
i went and told carmax and they said ford was lying .
_num_ hour later it was completed .
they tried to charge me $ _num_ for _num_ hours of labor .
they then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $ _num_ .
if this is their generic price for _num_ hour of labor it is ridiculous .
it should n't have take an hour to do it anyway .
the owner called me to apologize .
i probably wo n't be back .
i only stopped because i needed ta repair that day and they were close .
it is my pet peeve .
it is wrong .
i needed a patch so i could go on about my day .
the young man who greeted me seemed a little turned off by my coupon .
i thanked the jerk for his time and drove off .
he tried to `` screw '' me over .
bad move buddy .
are you freaking kidding me ?
i have never dealt with such poor management in my life .
i am brand new to the area and never ordered from this location before .
who knows , maybe i was going to order a pizza anyway !
the pizza was cut all messed up as well .
simply put , horrible experience .
send it my way , i 'll get you payment .
that same day i called another company and booked them with no issues .
i made a reservation on monday to pick up some equipment on saturday .
they confirmed my reservation on the phone .
no big deal .
dew & when they brought it out , it was in a can .
so , obviously , no free refills .
gross .
i stuck them in my mouth and wow ... they were flavorless .
ridiculous .
really sad about this one .
we normally delivery at work 2-3 or _num_ times a week .
the pricing is ridiculous .
this is not ihop quality food .
_num_ % of the time , the eggs are not done anyway .
i was very uncomfortable .
drinks are not made properly and the draft beer was warm .
from everyone , including bartenders , which is strange to say the least .
we 've been there twice and witnessed one fight per night .
dogs also get some time to run in a huge play area outside .
however , be sure to ask for a tour and see the space .
when we called they said no payment , no dogs .
they would not give me the dogs and work out a payment plan .
they said they have no idea where the dogs are now .
very disappointed !
i would not leave my dogs there .
quickly losing stars .
not a fan .
the employees and jewelry itself saved this review from being a _num_ star .
too bad , jared 's .
printed out my receipt .
couple weeks later , no phone call .
she was having a hard time finding my order .
ummm no ?
not coming back anymore after i find another band to replace this band .
poor customer service when trying to use reward from app .
this is a review of their business practices online .
slow , absolutely the worst .
horrible communication skills and customer service .
i visited recently and i will not be returning , ever !
at 1:30 i asked about my vehicle and was told i was next .
at _num_ pm i asked for my car .
there was no apology given or really any concern about customer service .
left this store and went to jiffy lube down the street .
hate the place !
this midas location is grossly overpriced !
beautiful courtyard less than _num_ yards away .
but no way to cancel , need _num_ hours notice for us ... .
there 's a reason no one goes here .
service is horrible .
do n't bother to stop .
you have been warned .
worst arby 's in the planet .
there were only two orders ahead of me , utterly ridiculous .
when we walked in , it was like we were in the south pacific .
the thermostat must have been set at _num_ .
maybe that 's for atmosphere , but it was not enjoyable .
it 's bad .
really bad .
otherwise , it stinks .
let me first tell you that i 'm not really a sushi guy .
but this was nasty .
that 's not too bad , right ?
add that to the place , the staff , the price - go elsewhere .
you 'll have a much nicer experience .
ugh ... do n't waste your time or your money !
skip everything else !
some things cold , when they should be hot .
not clean , either .
_num_ per person not worth it .
went for dinner tonight and was disgusted .
tons of garbage and food under these carts .
then all the food was cold and hard .
no idea why a restaurant owner would keep their place in this way .
avoid this place .
the other food was decent , but as i said before was cold .
did not like it .
not the cleanest establishment .
_num_ dollars for two that i 'll never see again .
do n't think i 'll be back .
stealing from your customers is not a great idea china buffet .
avoid this place like the plague !
twenty mins to close but was told that the kitchen was closed .
not going for it .
dried food stuck on silverware , glasses , and plates .
the food on the buffet was cold and tasted old .
the odd food selections are maybe a cross between southern style and fake chinese .
was n't impressed .
because there regular food is mall grade at best .
i do not eat sushi , however my husband does .
they need to be cleaning this dirty restaurant .
it 's definitely not the worst i 've ever had .
very poor .
just not worth it .
poor job .
pleasant staff , but poor quality work .
they damaged my car .
absolutely horrible customer service and product being sold to the public .
highly recommend you find another car wash .
poor customer service !
i wish i had read their reviews prior to going .
the only interior cleaning was vacuum .
they sprayed the windows but obviously allowed them to air dry .
i have paid $ _num_ for a car was and received a better quality .
it 's clear auto only cares about quantity not quality .
i would not recommend this company to anyone ever .
i past here daily and will never patronize this establishment again .
i 've taken my car here at least twice .
both times it failed on a defective license bulb .
well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations .
my guess is they were understaffed .
once we did get seated , service was slow and really bad .
not our best ihop experience .
unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that i ordered for dinner were foul .
without them i 'd have gone hungry that night .
i ordered the country sausage potatoes , pumpkin pancakes & grits .
cold grits are n't a treat .
it was n't the best meal as far as service was concerned .
apparently my empty glass was n't enough of a visual cue .
i 'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the french onion pot roast .
the soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt .
the pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever .
their orange juice is never too tart , never too sweet .
the mashed potatoes had clearly been in that serving bowl since the morning .
the omelet was uninspired .
it had no flavor whatsoever .
the red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them .
then the stack was topped with whipped cream .
god took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten .
terrible service and terrible food !
food was bland and tasteless and she never bothered to fill our drinks .
never coming back again , it was such a waste of money !
slow kitchen right .
in summary the service is very questionable .
i could n't agree more .
the place smells of old towels and the bathrooms are horrible .
over-priced , slow , very dirty , and an overall sketchy vibe .
not really .
was n't impressed .
the only thing they did n't want to do was flush my brake fluid .
guess it was ok ?
otherwise it was _num_ miles .
i did n't understand why he was asking that or the reason .
he could n't explain why he was asking the question either .
that was a little awkward though .
they are not very through .
he said , `` just grab your registration and come on in . ''
it stayed there for about _num_ minutes before i was called to the counter .
i lost out because the requested work was n't done .
no frills .
no fuss .
typical fast chinese food .
their prices are cheap , and our food was just ok .
i mean , there was oil dripping out of the inside .
almost as if it had been taking a bath in grease .
could have been a fluke , but i am guessing msg ?
, but a couple places in charlotte made me like it again .
this is not one of them .
would n't recommend .
giving _num_ stars instead of _num_ just cause i 've had worse .
boneless ribs were n't typical .
not rib meat .
very dry .
but bags were covered in grease .
i had to wash my hands just from opening the bag .
rice was over cooked .
complete mush .
there is no lobby .
this rink just did n't blow my mind .
i also wish that they would have set up some cones inside the rink .
they serve beer and wine !
really need to put some money into this place .
entire place smells like wet dog .
they have an assortment of beer and wine .
when that was fixed , the lines did n't roll over properly .
two different people in my office were reduced to tears .
the said they would get back to me within _num_ hours .
there are many places less expensive or where you get more for your money .
i ask again , are they hot ?
she did n't massage anything .
i have n't felt this ripped off in a very long time .
i fianc gave me a gift card here for my birthday .
he did the total opposite .
for $ _num_ i expected so expected something a lot better .
needless to say i am extremely displeased with my services here .
the only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout .
she clearly saw us walk up , and my mother go into the shop .
i continued to stand there , and finally she ( lindsey ) greeted me .
over crowded , loud , and not a relaxing experience .
stayed at the hotel and booked two massages .
sadly not worth the money or time .
i was planning to go again but not anymore .
services between spas are typically the same .
the locker room was ridiculously crowded ( too small ) .
this resort is most definitely not worth the ladies weekend .
it was over $ _num_ thrown in the trash .
i 've been a yelp user for years .
i come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left .
why take down my room number if you were n't going to call me ?
waited for the shuttle around _num_ min at the airport .
i got rid of it myself , though lol .
i would give this place a _num_ star if i could !
this is not the courtyard i was expecting .
common areas needed to be vacuumed !
but their repeated attempts to enter woke us up .
then staff tried to get in !
coffee pot in our room was broken .
_num_ stars might be too generous !
this place is awful .
the internet is so slow it is not functional for basic email .
this trip has no internet .
this place is disgusting .
my room was not clean .
the air did not function properly .
very disappointed .
they were gracious to direct us to signs that got us out of parking .
this place charges $ _num_ for _num_ minutes .
there was no attendant at the booth when we left .
luckily , we had two $ _num_ dollar bills and it worked .
bank of america credit cards are sticky with fees that you do n't deserve .
lo and behold , twenty minutes later , they called us back over .
it was clear servicing customers was an inconvenience to him .
customer friendly said there is nothing he can do .
when i complained how they failed to honor my reservation mr .
at this office any reservation you have is basically worthless .
nor has the manager ever returned my message .
i had two dogs , fries , and a coke for lunch .
frankly ( haha ) , it did n't do anything for me .
maybe the hot dog is cold , but the chili is hot .
i want to like this place , but just ca n't .
the chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat texas pete canned chilli .
if i could give less than one star , i would .
let 's start with having a _num_ sanitation rating .
ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients ( ie american cheese and ketchup ) .
it was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries .
the chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless .
maybe i just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day .
did n't see too much in particular that i loved about this place .
and once again , pretty nasty .
no thanks .
three strikes jackson 's , you wo n't see me again .
walking through the halls it becomes evident this is an old hotel .
the bathroom was awful , bedding lumpy and ancient , and the lighting poor .
will not be staying here again .
the place was so slow .
$ _num_ and we both left and ate pizza .
this was not a four star dining experience .
really disappointing .
no one wanted to complain as it was a customer event .
but i would have sent it back if i were on my own .
four star _num_ diamond yea right .
no creativity to the cooking .
at times we could barely hear ourselves think , let alone hear each other .
the steak was overcooked .
the cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert .
turns out , that wine was not included and was a $ _num_ bottle .
most of our bill was the wine .
could have being very good but it was not .
i find it acceptable , but nothing special .
in fact , the menu is , to me , kinda boring .
the waitress was n't rude , but she just was n't there .
i guess for $ _num_ i could n't complain .
bad food .
bug problem .
also my veggies were n't seasoned at all and were not even steamed .
nothing special on this menu ... .
the food , on the other hand , is not good .
spicy crab soup did not have crab meant in it .
it was n't even spicy .
no , the waiter was quick to tell me i ordered medium rare .
by now , my companions had finished eating .
the meat was so tough , i gave up after a few pieces .
nothing to write home about .
do n't understand the hype .
not a good dinner place .
this showmars used to be awesome .
i would have given it _num_ stars .
this showmars is under new management and it sucks !
also , the portions are not as big .
change management and has gone down hill .
it 's slow , portions are smaller and the staff is terrible .
missed opportunity .
gone was the flavor and little taste of spicy burn at the end .
major disappointment !
i asked wth and they told me , management change .
that makes me so sad knowing i will never experience that wonderful flavor again .
good food , but poor service at this particular location .
a shame .
i 'll continue to frequent other locations , just not this particular one .
i 'm sorry but what is the big deal ?
and everything is ala carte !
no way .
i was not impressed by anything here .
but quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments .
he apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone .
the bartender never came back to me to take my drink order .
as diners we would like prompt service and attention but this was not good .
highly disappointed !
the last two times i have been there were not good .
it appears that the oven was too hot .
my steak was not cooked to the right temperature - well vs medium well .
poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality .
nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive .
i would recommend capital grille over morton 's .
an hour .
_num_ ) write down orders so you do n't forget .
we do n't care !
i wish i could leave a no star rating .
service was awful .
the bartenders had no desire to serve `` us '' .
worst steakhouse experience i have had to date !
we may have waited _num_ minutes before our table was ready .
at this point we still had not seen our server .
i poured my own wine refills .
we ate our dinner quickly because of how hungry we were .
very little apology from the staff about the horrible experience .
even at the discounted price we paid for queens feast we felt robbed .
_num_ of _num_ of our steaks came out totally wrong .
chili 's can cook a better steak than them .
ridiculous .
this last experience was by far the most disappointing .
_num_ sides came out late .
i ordered the bone in fillet , they brought me a ribeye .
so i had to eat my sides cold .
the flavor is ok but why is the dog so skinny ?
they made it anyway and gave it to me .
there is no excuse .
they did not have many items .
do they not make fresh brew coffee .
maybe this starbucks just want to sell all the coffee they made this morning .
starbucks is not the right one for me .
not like you starbucks !
cool sports bar , pool tables and ample flat screens .
but this was pretty bad .
ok , mistake .
it just is n't up my alley though .
also the bathrooms where in bad shape .
i really hate this place .
i 've given it _num_ chances , and they all sucked .
food was awful .
staff was overwhelmed , they tried , but to no avail .
this is the first , and probably only , negative review i have posted .
simply a bad experience .
the food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm .
i refuse to ever set foot in this sub-par establishment again .
pretty obvious the waitress did n't know the table numbers .
at the same time she got sat another table of _num_ women .
the beer specials and _num_ .
seems he was already looking to replace the manager .
we walked in and it was awkward .
no waitress no one else walking around .
we counted _num_ parties , thats it ... in a otherwise bare restaurant .
our drinks were refilled often without being asked .
will not be back .
we just received the worst service ever i will never come back .
service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly .
it was awful we could n't find any positive in it .
it was _num_ of us and _num_ ppl got their checks .
to further add to the drama , the parking garage has virtually no signage !
a shame , really , for my once favorite bar in charlotte .
went in to meet some friends who 'd come in from out of town .
the music was too loud for conversation .
summary : very noisy , terrible service .
wild dogs could n't drag me back .
i stood there for approx 5-7 mins before i was even acknowledged .
my braised short ribs were all bones !
i sent their management a message , but have not yet heard back .
been here twice ; both times it was an awful experience .
we will not be going back .
apparently , reservations are not valued here .
he needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made .
did n't get our food until after _num_ .
food is n't good either .
greasy and the batter was peeling off .
i did n't get what i ordered .
i over cooked greasy fries like everyone else .
it had shoe string onion rings and slaw on it .
stopped in after the theater for a pint , but could not get served .
so , we again waited & never did see a server .
there was absolutely no seasoning on them and they had zero taste .
even adding salt and pepper did not help it .
i called the manager over , to let them know the situation .
easily takes _num_ min to get a drink .
for $ _num_ i 'd expect a lot more .
the rose sauce was n't as flavorful as i would expect .
that is a lot for a less than adequate sandwhich .
i will not be coming back .
just average unfortunately .
the mediocre : everything else .
the really really low point of the meal was the desert .
the bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock .
and questioned why it was cold .
bread pudding is always warm no ?
lobster and potato cakes could have been better - too salty imo .
even the door man commented on how rude the bartenders were .
never going back .
the menu is n't extensive , so keep in mind your options are limited .
and , all were nothing to write home about .
not worth it .
know your customers , bring back the stew .
hostess was extremely unprofessional and rude !
no one was uptown and the place was completely empty .
worst lunch option uptown .
i will not be returning .
my lunch companion had roast beef and regretted ordering anything .
server was very slow and was n't attentive .
bouncer was extremely rude .
we had a reservation for _num_ for a casual business dinner .
it took _num_ minutes to get our server to take our dinner order .
it was very difficult to get our server 's attention throughout the evening .
the food came quick but no potato soup .
the service itself was n't to great either .
the wait staff was not that great either !
the bartenders attitude were like `` we r annoyed cause we r there '' .
we walked in and waited to be sat .
no one came or even looked at us .
the bartender looked at us walked away .
after _num_ minutes he never returned .
when i come back to charlotte i wo n't be trying this restaurant again .
i had carryout .
very quick but kinda confusing to find the place .
so far i have not found a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
i would not recommend the spring rolls they are kinda bland .
still looking for a good chinese food place here in charlotte wish me luck !
sad to say , my entree was a little bland .
it was a tofu , vegetables , and wide rice noodles entree .
food is decent , but service is no good .
unfortunately , went in for lunch today and had a similar experience with service .
will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 pm .
they are rude .
literally rude .
half the time you do n't understand what they speak in english .
no in this restaurant are polite .
unfortunately , the food was sub-par .
i ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp .
i got the steamed chicken dumplings and a order of edamame to go .
the worst part were the soy beans .
when i got the food it was cold and i was so disappointed .
otherwise , i do n't think i 'll order from there again .
if so , then you 'll want to take a pass on this place .
the food by best is subpar and barely mediocre .
the lady at the front desk is absolutely rude rude rude rude .
disgusting phone etiquette and completely appalling .
so sad .
used to be so much better .
no flavor .
everything we ordered was very very bland .
very disappointed in my charlotte chinese .
wo n't be back .
i ca n't imagine how this place has _num_ stars .
fried dumplings were thick and mushy .
the ramen soup was bland .
egg roll was sour of all things .
hot and sour soup also bland .
very bland .
very very bland .
not much pineapple in the chicken pineapple dish .
nor is there any hint of a true thai taste .
i also ordered the curry chicken noodle bowl .
again , very bland .
not much of a coconut taste either .
the _num_ starts are just because the broccoli looks fresh .
not sure if i 'll try again .
instead , it was dry and tasteless i know filling .
waste of a cheat meal .
worst chinese food i 've had in a while .
have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on ?
this seemed quite bizarre .
also , why have _num_ screens when you can have one huge one ?
why give french fries with most of them burned ?
food is terrible .
everybody has bad days , they should not be this bad ... .
the chicken wings tasted like fake butter and rubber .
it 's my fault , i guess .
the kids menu was quite pathetic and expensive !
$ _num_ for two small hamburgers ?
i had the thai beef salad and it had about _num_ strips of beef .
flavor was ok but the lack of real substance was overbearing to anything else .
aside from just being terrible , she was also unfriendly .
as a vegetarian , it was entirely another matter for me .
what was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip .
i only gave them _num_ star because _num_ was n't an option .
horrible experience .
the bread was cold and hard .
we had to go , it was getting way too late .
went here a night during final four ( basket ball ) .
the bar was not to noisy and the server was very attentive .
tried their philly cheese steak .
sorry guys you really need to repair the beer machine and hire a cook .
as for a place to spend money uptown i 'd skip it .
the bar is ok , the food is ok , it 's nothing special .
i will never go back to this place , to many other options uptown .
when my food came out , the chicken was cold .
the only thing i liked was their ranch sauce .
it was kind of uncomfortable .
no management present that we could see .
so , why only _num_ stars you ask ?
it 's horrible .
i would n't be as concerned if i were here for pleasure .
so , you get where this is going , right ?
walking into the hotel , it smelled stale .
room three does n't smell much better .
again , stale and moldy .
i like the quiche every morning rotating variety everyday .
but my room is outdated and smells like there has been a massive leak .
not a good sign .
this place is not worth the price !
only _num_ stars for location .
worst hotel i have yet to stay in as a consultant .
wow , i was wrong .
we decided to try room service ... what a mistake .
i talked to the duty manager and he was no help at all .
i found all of this very unacceptable .
it reflects poorly on the entire hotel .
two of my colleagues also have lost stuff in this hotel .
but i strongly believe that the staff in their housekeeping department are not honest .
the room i stayed in was old and run down .
the biggest problem i had though was the paper thin walls .
water pressure in the shower was also horrible .
my biggest complaint though is the housekeeping staff .
loud , loud , loud !
this was my second time staying at this hotel with the same problem .
the `` new '' rooms are terrible .
for a downtown attempt at luxury this is bad .
terrible for business travel .
no desk , no real work surface but an oversized tv tray .
no desk type chair .
which the bench under the tv is an absolutely terrible idea !
just a poor design all around .
rooms are poorly designed .
faux wood floor makes everything echo .
in fact faux wood furniture all around .
while they are remodeling this is no longer a business class hotel .
why in _num_ are hotels still doing this ?
the room are _num_ stars .
when we got back to our hotel .
_num_ caesar salad with flank steak and another caesar salad with shrimps !
both salad looked like they been sitting out for awhile .
stomach hurts all night .
oh well , their loss .
i was seated and served a complimentary salad .
i expressed my disappointment and said please do what you need to do .
terrible customer service !
menu says `` soup '' , no particular type .
waitress said i could double rice , but no soup change .
the place was empty when we got there and when we left .
... no wonder .
one star because zero was n't an option .
oh and the sushi was not fresh and tasted gross .
nigiri sushi was not good at all and neither were the rolls .
they just said thank you and walked away .
we ordered hibachi steak chicken and shrimp with fried rice and vegetables .
was not impressed at all .
did not taste like hibachi at all .
sushi might be good , but i do n't eat sushi .
i just had such a bad experience here .
the employees were extremely rude , the food is overpriced and mediocre .
do n't even get me started .
but the service is horrible .
if i was n't vegan , i 'd eat the dish .
i got uncomfortable with the waitress so i told another waitress about my situation .
do n't think i 'll be coming back .
i used their online service to pick up my laundry .
for three days no one called or picked up the clothes .
i would certainly not recommend this dry cleaners to anyone .
an expensive hassle for such terrible service .
what a mistake it was .
but they are n't reliable .
he truly comes across as if he could care less , and it shows .
breaking off buttons then charging to put back on .
they do n't care about your clothes .
pay more elsewhere for better quality .
i ordered the seabass and it really was n't anything spectacular .
i visited charlotte and decided to go here , cause it was crowded .
there was nothing really special about the food .
i 'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience .
needless to say none of us wanted to order another round of drinks .
could n't you have just lied to me and told me you were out ?
dont get me wrong , i kinda like applebees .
just dont expect anything amazing .
that might make it a little better .
their menu is way overpriced , with nothing really great on it .
the beer was decent , it 's just draft beer here .
but i do n't think i 'll be going back anytime soon .
ate here on a saturday night for a friend 's birthday .
our server , from beginning to end , was slow .
would have rather spent $ _num_ elsewhere .
also they were not that tender .
my wife had the chicken pesto pasta .
while that was decent , it was n't exciting either .
i mean , we went here thinking we would get a good value .
unfortunately , it 's more than a lot of other comparable places in uptown .
too many other choices in charlotte to come back here .
i have mixed feelings about rock bottom .
unfortunately that burger was `` _num_ 'd '' ... as was her second choice .
i will not be going back .
the food was bad , yo .
like , below applebee 's bad .
i also ordered the southwestern turkey burger .
i was n't impressed with this place .
the beer is awesome i will admit and the servers are pretty attentive .
i ate a little bit , but i did n't want to finish it .
way too much pepper or spices , and i could hardly taste the cheese .
we walked out and still nobody noticed .
this used to be my favorite place uptown .
really disappointed .
really , are they kidding serving store bought salsa ?
the chicken sandwich was burnt and you cook smell the burn !
not sure we would return anytime soon .
bad service and mediocre food served cold .
the kicker is that this was n't the first time this has happened .
if i could give negative star rating i would .
it was not especially crowded ( no wait ) and we had reservations .
chicken fried chicken for three of us and my wife had the sizzling peppers .
more pear shaped , waitress was no where to be found for _num_ minutes .
the rating is not for the appetizer , like i said things happen .
i took my young son with me so it was just dinner no alcohol .
we did n't see him again until after our food was brought to us .
the beer was pretty good , but the food was a real disappointment .
i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .
the wings were fine , but nothing special .
the restaurant was busy , but was n't packed .
overall they get a d for food and an a for ambience and location .
then no , i have not gotten my beer .
she again left for another _num_ minutes .
was someone else supposed to bring it , did she forget ?
the chicken was supposed to be grilled .
fries with burger were luke warm .
as late as it was , there was no offer to comp the pizza .
but obviously we have no plans to go back .
ick !
half the time our drinks were empty .
so what was the point in an app ?
there were tiny pieces of what looked like artificial crab .
no lobster .
caesar salad should not be too spicy to eat .
i 'd give it zero stars but yelp wo n't let me .
i have eaten here several times & always find it disappointing .
tried a variety of foods & none have been particularly good .
there are no free meals in america andrea !
i would n't even give this place a star for this reason !
we had the worst experience at this place !
it ruined our first visit in charlotte .
their service was horrible and i would never go to any rock bottom !
establishment was not busy at all , decided to seat ourselves at the bar .
this place just does not seem serious about business standards and drinks were weak .
fianc ordered bison burger and ended up getting a 2am with egg , etc .
apparently it 's supposed to be `` loaded '' with roasted chicken .
bun was also cold like just out of the refrigerator .
unacceptable .
i thought it was odd how many empty tables were in the bar area .
i 'd give only _num_ star , but previous visits were acceptable .
not edible .
came in for a quick bite to eat on a sunday for lunch .
the chicken was flavorless and tough .
the fries were cold and mushy .
will not come back here .
the service was very slow and obviously not very interested in being there .
the food was also disappointing .
the chicken breast was so small .
worse was that there was no flavor .
it was just all around bland .
would recommend not sitting outside or at the bar if you want food .
stopped in before the panthers sunday night game .
gross .
bartenders were terrible and not attentive .
waited _num_ minutes before someone asked if we needed something .
unacceptable .
do the bartenders here not work on tips ?
only plus is the beer was $ _num_ and they validate parking .
nobody tried to even convince us to stay .
2nd time service was extremely slow .
nothing that really stands out .
the beginning check in should 've been a red flag for us to run .
_num_ minutes later we were sat .
some drinks were returned from the bar while some never reached the table .
neither of us touched our food .
another couple ordered the cajun pasta and brewery beef tips .
no checks .
we paid for drinks and left our sever a gracious tip .
finally i flagged down a waiter and asked to see the manager .
well , the customer service did n't get much better .
i said it was ok and that i would rather have a mixed drink .
i was starving so at this point i just made do .
when it came down to orders and service though , sadly was disappointed .
the veggies were overly salty table round .
and meats were not cooked to request and the servers forgot the eating utensils .
after _num_ more min .
i was n't particularly hungry and ordered the mexican street tacos .
the broccoli was terrible .
the beer was good , service was ok , but the food was terrible .
i ordered lobster & shrimp `` enchiladas '' , which had practically no filling .
in short , our experience here was awful .
the burgers were just okay .
not particularly flavorful but edible .
the sticks were not actually pretzels .
the did n't look or taste like pretzels , rather like breadsticks .
the cheesy jalapeno dip it was served with was good .
the chicken tacos were good .
i personally ordered the lobster and shrimp tacos and they were served cold .
they were served with a side of bland , instant rice and black beans .
the biggest negative about rock bottom is by far the service .
the service was awful .
it then took quite awhile for our dinners to start arriving .
and then _num_ minutes later , a fifth entree was brought out .
it was not a gluten free menu at all !
very disappointed with this restaurant .
this place was horrible !
do n't get married here .
that was $ _num_ down the drain .
this place is beautiful but not worth the money , stress , or headache .
fish was not fresh .
the manager claims he is very helpful ?
he is not !
this fast food place almost always gets my order wrong .
they charge me for things that they do n't have .
besides the staff being extremely unprofessional , the wait time is always long .
the cashier was very polite , inviting , and helpful .
seems like they used imitation cheese , because it certainly didnt melt .
do n't waste your time ... .
this is not a really cool hang out .
the bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly .
the place just seemed small and shabby to me .
the restaurant was pretty empty , no wait for a table .
we started off with two appetizers : calamari and crab dip .
we just ignored this and ate the calamari , as is .
the crab dip was another disappointment .
the cheese was loaded on the top with almost no crab flavor .
wow , this was just embarrassing ( for them ) .
i had about _num_ bites and just put it aside .
the food was decent but _num_ issues , _num_ major one .
first - the water at this establishment is disgusting .
it was very , very bad .
very bad .
so very bad that i 'm writing my first yelp review .
i will tell people not to go there and i will never go back .
[ the bad . ]
the temperature in the restaurant was hot .
_num_ outside , _num_ inside .
which is just weird in a restaurant setting .
he said , `` we only have _num_ .
we usually have _num_ but we ran out of _num_ today . ''
my order was wrong .
i sucked it up and ate the stupid beef .
the beef was very pink in the middle and was of extremely poor quality .
[ the not so bad . ]
like i said maybe just an off night but we wo n't be back .
so , let 's make that a _num_ stars .
restaurant dot com you 've let me down once again .
i 've got to ask myself why do i keep doing this .
no excuse for an overcooked steak ever , and all ordered medium rare .
avoid this place even if free .
very poor service .
the chicken tasted suspect and the rice was mushy .
seafood noodle soup had slices of pork .
the cilantro garnish was n't even chopped .
the potatoes were like tater tots .
no ketchup ?
it wasnt horrible , it just wasnt great .
this could be an awesome place to stay .
i was given a sofa bed to sleep on .
i had made the reservation several weeks prior , with guaranteed late arrival .
i get to the room and the electronic key does not work .
his key does not work either .
later they apologize for the error .
the bar area has maybe half a dozen customers at the time .
a gym attendant wants you to sign in but has no pen .
they also tend to forget some essential ( i.e .
i absolutely hate this place .
btw , no one ever showed up to fix the air .
this is the first time i feel compelled to write a bad review .
the hotel rooms were dirty and service was terrible .
it was not my pillow .
( but they have still not done this _num_ weeks later ) .
i can only say that this hotel has zero commitment to customer service .
the beds were uncomfortable .
_num_ coke = $ _num_ .
i will never be back .
do not stay here if you have a choice .
to add insult to injury , the only restaurant in the hotel sucks .
no concierge .
the hilton would probably have been better or perhaps any of the other hotels .
do n't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler .
i stayed three nights at the westin with a group for a conference .
two cups of coffee per room per day , extras can be purchased .
so why the low rating ?
here 's the bad points .
wouldnt you think they would have an attendant check on the bathroom on occasion .
big disappointment ... try the hilton .
but its definitely not worth the money .
the fitness center lacks a fan , so working out gets too hot .
i feel like i should only be spending maybe $ _num_ .
otherwise , i will never stay at this place .
there are much better choices in uptown charlotte !
now the bad ... stains .
there is no other way to describe everything in my room .
they just need a better starting product !
i did not find the venue pleasant .
it was then i noticed small mold spots in the shower .
the ac in the room also did not seem to operate properly .
no way it got near _num_ or i would have been freezing .
got _num_ bites for one night .
he also suggested me to go to er if not getting better .
obviously management is not training well for customer service at this location .
conference rooms were poorly set-up , freezing cold , and loud !
avoid the valet at all costs !
description said grain mustard cole slaw and pickles .
the coleslaw was a couple pieces of lettuce with some carrots .
either the batteries are almost dead or its just terrible .
at _num_ am and two phone calls , still no coffee .
no apologies .
big box , impersonal hotel .
the views are not worth it .
time to check out and never come back .
staff was supposed to help with a reservation and dropped the ball .
the hotel is starting to look warn and needs investment .
total time spent _num_ hour for a $ _num_ drink .
no ... not a sir and i wanted to order mozzarella wheels .
`` oh ok that 'll be $ _num_ . ''
i pretty much hate this hotel .
this hotel is a complete ripoff !
other than that , customer service is awful .
the restaurant is the worst .
and they got my order wrong .
how the heck do you get that order wrong ?
we were disappointed in this hotel .
lobby bar staff was unfriendly .
we stayed for four nights and got minimal cleaning service in our room .
the phone call from the manager @ 7:00 am ruined the trip for me .
i did n't appreciate it , understand it , or like it at all .
this is the worst westin i 've ever stayed in .
i even asked my husband to check in case i missed it .
i waited about _num_ mins and still no menu .
we check in , we get the wrong room .
their televisions could be called outdated ... at best .
they tried to fix the broken telephone but were n't really successful .
i stayed here for a week .
i dunno .
both experiences have been terrible .
it was fixed promptly , but made a bad first impression .
quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life .
noisy , dirty , poorly renovated and the worst customer service known to man .
does n't even deserve one star in my book .
avoid at all costs !
the rooms were clean but i would not stay here again .
it 's awful and we wo n't be going back .
the worst of our experience ?
if anyone 's had theft problems , this may be why .
there are many choices in charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one .
under renovations until december _num_ , _num_ .
the staff was friendly every time we walked past the front desk .
the restaurant across the street was apparently a night club as well .
we tried to nap but simply could n't .
more screaming and yelling than the night before .
it literally sounds like there is a major concert going on .
the staff called the cops who are apparently there but not doing anything .
i stayed at this motel for _num_ nights ( june 19th & 20th ) .
i called & talked to manger as soon as i saw the bites .
when we checked out i spoke to manager & showed her my bites .
i 'm still waiting to find out what ate me up !
no way would i ever stay at this motel again .
beware veterans , they do not acknowledge war .
no more .
veterans beware !
do not stay st this hotel .
do n't expect too much .
the room doors are all spring loaded to they slam shut .
not a quiet hotel at anytime of the day .
we went on a friday and it was n't too busy .
and they did n't seem too concerned about my complaint .
and the bathrooms were nasty .
bottom line is poor excuses for terrible work .
sorry for the comment .
i signed up as they knocked at my door .
i was a customer for approx _num_ yrs .
only because they were my only option .
time warner cable is awful .
also , they really have the worst customer service i have ever dealt with .
its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone ?
would that have been so difficult ?
well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try .
horrible !
worst service ever !
i get it .
however , the sucker that i am for a deal , i got it .
shame on you , time warner cable .
some of the worst service ever .
i then recieved the bill the next month and the price had no change .
ok , no big deal .
she talked to the computer screen instead of to my face .
talk about unpleasant .
terrible customer service .
called back and was told wait time would be _num_ minutes .
i read somewhere that charlotte has the highest time warner rates in the country .
avoid this company if you can .
once they have you they make it hard to escape .
do n't even get me started with their customer service , or lack of .
when i finally get someone on the phone , they are rarely helpful .
possible the most frustrating company i have ever interacted with .
since they apparently hire good people , hire more !
the folks on the phone are incredibly rude .
absolute _num_ % avoid at all costs .
there is no email and i have spent hours on the phone .
i do not like this company !
inconsistent billing , poor customer service , and lies sum up this service .
ca n't wait for more service providers .
are you kidding me time warner ?
let 's add up those dollars , shall we , time warner ?
i also wish that i could provide them with zero stars .
this company is the worst to deal with .
after about _num_ minutes she realized she was entering it incorrectly .
therefore they installer never made it to my apartment .
but i placed the order online , then i am on hold again .
i 'm done i throw in the towel trying to deal with them .
why did n't i go with them first ?
should n't be too hard of a task , yeah ?
wrong .
how can i help you today ? ''
( _num_ minutes of this ) .
`` ok , sir .
( _num_ minutes on hold ) ... ... ... ... ... ... still transferred .
`` hello , sir .
the story does n't end there .
bad idea .
horrible service !
i vote time warner cable the worst company of all times .
do n't get me wrong there are other bad and good companies .
after that i would say sprint is the 5th worst .
so , i get online again , and guess what ?
worst customer service of any business i 've ever dealt with .
i am not holding my breath here .
i wish there were zero stars .
horrible , horrible company .
took me over an hour on the call but nothing had been done .
worst service ever !
the drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous .
worse customer service ever .
before i talked to them , i could change channels and had a picture .
the worst place on earth .
what a joke of a company .
i did not have internet for about a month .
so one month _num_ tech support calls later i got this information .
time warner cable is the worst !
stay away from them like the plague if possible .
the first winter storm and the cable and internet is out .
no way to find out what is going on .
stay away from time warner .
time warner cable has the absolute worst customer service i have ever come across .
if i could leave a lower rating , i would .
absolute thieves and liars .
i feel like i 'm in line for a bad carnival ride !
this is absolutely the worst place i 've ever been to .
do you ever leave a place and feel exhausted ?
this is the worst line i have ever seen in my life .
well they delayed the change for _num_ weeks so they could collect more longer .
the whole call took _num_ minutes most of it on hold .
poor customer service .
i would gladly give less than one star , alas , not possible !
not to mention the constant slow internet .
you 'll never get out unless you die .
terrible customer service .
ca n't wait to cancel service .
just know that they have horrible customer service and technicians .
no one ever knows what they are talking about and problems are never resolved .
if you can help it , do n't get cable from this cable company .
worst customer service and business model i have ever seen .
literally , anywhere .
we 've been going through the same problems for years now .
to any new potential new customer out there , please be warned .
just do n't do it !
i have never been so disappointed with a company .
i have to wait _num_ days to have service restored .
i can not recommend this company .
first , let me say i wish you could leave _num_ stars .
its crime and misleading to even give time warner _num_ star !
i do n't even see how time warner is even in business !
the sad part is that its not even the technicians fault .
_num_ up ?
another appointment was setup , and yet again no call and no show .
worst company ever .
ca n't wait till google comes to save us .
worst run business in the free world .
wanting faster internet i signed up .
they are out dated and their customer `` service '' is non existent .
they do n't care about anyone .
the worst everything .
worst ever at everything they do .
if i could give negative stars i would .
eventually they brought me something but they were just sooo rude .
will never go back to that place again .
the person that seated us was curt and unfriendly .
the dishes that night were sub-par , which was a first .
i honestly have no clue !
only good thing about this place was my company .
finally this place was stale like the bread !
could n't have happened to a more deserving group of people .
found out he left less than a month after this incident .
plus , cold rude staff .
my trim & partial high lights took _num_ 1/2 hours though !
so i would say , sure - check them out .
just be sure to make your appointment with someone with experience .
$ _num_ pedicure should have been way better than it was .
skip it and try somewhere else for a spa pedicure .
safe to say , i was really upset and disappointed when i left .
first , they charge for beer and wine .
this results in my paying $ _num_ i should n't have had to pay .
too big , almost .
so many fountains , open areas , gardens to visit .
look , stop being cheap .
lame .
this place is horrible .
they lead me to each exit , and each time they were locked .
not so much at uptown charlotte .
the door not only did n't close , it did n't fit the frame .
but for a few seconds , water completely stops .
terrible front desk staff & way over priced .
the front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin .
she kept answering the phone even though others were there .
made a one night stay $ _num_ .
i can send it to marriott if requested . )
coffee makers were loudly talking , and seemed annoyed at my presence .
wo n't be returning .
worst experience of my life .
tried to buy a book and have it shipped as a christmas present .
my simple question was : do you price match to you own website ?
his immediate reaction was rolling his eyes and said no we do n't !
i do n't want anyone else to go through this .
this review is for alterations only .
not measured correctly - very angry !
gross .
maybe i chose poorly but i was n't impressed at all .
smoked salmon plus creamy sauce , yum .
the underwhelming : the french onion soup was not hot .
maybe , to try the breakfast everyone seems to enjoy so much .
but probably not for dinner .
`` every christmas story ever told '' was slow and not that funny .
the first half dragged .
worse than cans .
is it worth the $ _num_ cover on fridays ?
not really .
i thought it was a bit too much .
this really is n't somewhere i want to be .
i 'm _num_ and i almost felt too old there .
but maybe that says more about me than it does bar charlotte .
for that reason , i ca n't give this place less than two stars .
$ _num_ for anything !
i just came from there .
i grabbed my daughter by the arm and led her out of there .
it is not safe for kids !
they changed it without notice , i 'm a little bitter .
it 's _num_ or _num_ bucks now after _num_ .
it 's not worth it .
i did n't touch anyone .
worst bar ever .
never going back .
i ordered smoked pork chops , home fries and green beans .
it was a total disappointment for me .
i was embarrassed for recommending this restaurant .
the fried chicken was straight forward .
it was a tad weird .
the collards were authentic and would get them again .
overall rating - just an ok .
however the experience here was not very good !
i was unable to comfortably eat for approx .
_num_ to _num_ minutes .
i ordered fried chicken , greens , yams , catfish , and banana pudding .
_num_ ) the fried chicken was n't really fried .
it looked like baked chicken that was dried out .
not crispy looking , not seasoned .
not very tasty .
_num_ ) the catfish was a complete fish with bones .
_num_ ) banana pudding was very good !
_num_ ) red beans rice and sausage was not good .
to many restaurants want my patronage .
however , it all went down hill from there .
finally , we just said thanks , but no thanks and left .
the only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread .
the food was alright and i thought that the portions were a good size .
but i think that the service was absolutely terrible .
i will not eat there again .
i rarely give bad reviews , but this was a pretty horrible food experience .
huge disappointment .
the fried chicken was pretty bland .
it seemed like it was pre-made and left out for too long .
the collard greens were insanely salty .
instant high blood pressure for sale !
: ( i ordered the salmon cakes which were really hard .
fried chicken , macaroni and cheese and collards .
the chicken was tasteless and the mac was bland .
the service was n't great either .
not impressed .
i went a second time just in case they were having a bad day .
the catfish was fried too hard and did not have any meat on it .
the okra and tomatoes were alright .
the service here sucks .
never going to go back again .
horrible !
not really impressed .
however , she did n't bother , probably because we were n't her table .
overall experience could have been better , but at least we tried it .
even the home fries where spicy .
i needed usually needed to wait and attempt to attract her attention .
the economy is not doing well.
with that said ... mert 's was disappointing and overpriced .
the mac n cheese and pound cake was ok at best .
the greens and yams were ok .
horrible !
i would not recommend this place and would never go back .
i ca n't believe people like this food .
to tell the truth , the service ran along the lines of pretty poor .
she never refilled our drinks either .
the fried green tomatoes had a very heavy batter on them .
it was hard to find `` tomatoes '' in the dish .
waitresses was pushing hard on the chicken tenders that she loved .
surprisingly , none of it was really that good .
service was cheerful though .
my biggest problem was the service .
she was surly and very uninterested in doing her job .
honestly some of the worst service i 've ever received anywhere .
my husband and i are pretty patient people , but this was ridiculous .
fried chicken , chicken tenders , and salmon cakes were also okay .
try a waffle house and i think you 'll have a better dining experience .
servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable .
however , the food ... .
sucked .
the collards were not cook well and my salmon patties were burnt .
this was not good soul food at all .
i liked the atmosphere but the food was way too salty .
just did n't care for it .
the yams were out of a can so that was a major let down .
seems like a tourist spot to me .
the food left a lot to be desired .
reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough .
really disappointing .
this smell will stick to you for four to five hours at least .
the corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant .
i ordered chicken wings which was cold and `` rubbery '' .
the service on the other hand was not .
i was confused asked to speak tho the manager by another waitress .
that waitress says sure she 's the lady over there in the red shirt .
so needless to say we will not be returning back to this establishment ever !
the collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes .
my kids would not even eat them .
not so !
all said , we spent $ _num_ for soul food !
this place is not worth the price .
what a disappointment !
but the real let down was my shrimp and grits .
no seasoning .
no flavor .
my husband and i went to mert 's on sunday morning around _num_ .
not one said i will be your server i will be with you shortly .
not one said would you like some water .
not one said let me find who your server is .
this went one for _num_ minutes before we decided to get up and leave !
the service is terrible !
ultimately , there was confusion about who was responsible for our table .
she indicated that a long wait to be acknowledged is not common practice .
she invited me back to the restaurant .
but it was cheap and the corn bread was excellent .
every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable .
the worst customer service by server and manager .
tonight 's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
supposedly there was a computer error with our food .
however while waiting two hours , we repeatedly asked our server about our dinner .
consider actually checking on the food .
all the tables around us came , ate and left .
she did not even follow through on that promise .
pathetic .
over _num_ % of the restaurant was filled with people from our convention .
the server never apologized .
nor did he bother to even clear our plates .
finally i had enough and walked out .
horrible customer service !
( not the waitress ) .
she was sarcastic & unprofessional .
the waitress could have cared less that we had to wait .
horrible service !
came back _num_ minutes later with lame lie .
another _num_ minutes later still no food , not even apps .
hostess also provided _num_ new lame lies .
dishonest staff ruined it for me .
chicken was dry , green beans under seasoned and bland .
the macaroni was good , they used cream cheese or something that tasted okay .
they got two orders wrong in our party of _num_ though .
over three hour wait for mediocre food and poor service .
one food runner , female , came to our table with the wrong food .
let 's just say everyone has something bad to say about their entree meal .
service was extremely slow .
it was cold and soggy .
the mac and cheese was good but again , it 's mac and cheese .
would n't go back .
the worst restaurant ever !
the service is the worst !
lazy and slow as ever !
do n't know what that meant ; did they run out of spinach ?
we ended up with two other omelettes , the garden and the shrimp creole .
however , we were highly disappointed by the food .
not the best soul good i 've ever eaten .
the fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about .
mac n cheese can pass for soul food .
corn bread mediocre , overall it was okay .
big fail on that expectation .
we did n't know if her reaction would be positive or negative .
after paying my bill i waited for my change that never came .
the waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering .
this was by far the worst soul food experience .
second time may be a charm but the first time was a complete failure .
the yams were hard as if they were freshly cut and simply plated .
tiger wood drinks were very tasty .
our server was not at all attentive to our needs .
the initial one that i received had obviously been sitting out too long .
it was cold .
overall , the experience was not very pleasing .
however , this was our experience .
not a fan of anything here .
bbq was disgusting and swimming in grease .
potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat .
and it was over $ _num_ for lunch .
not worth the drive , parking , or time .
slow service con this cold and wet monday .
mac & cheese was watery .
this place was a huge disappointment for me .
i had the worst lunch of all times here today .
i had such awesome memories of it and the food was to die for .
worst of all , our server gave us the worst service .
never once quality checked us .
i did n't leave a tip and i am a former server !
for southern home cooking , this was an insult .
im sorry .
the worst experience on my first outing in my city .
i waited for _num_ minutes before anyone came and spoke to me .
this is n't the first time this happened .
overall i was very stuffed at the end of my meal .
overall , my experience was just ok , but nothing memorable .
although nothing was awful , i would n't come back .
i really , really wanted to like this place .
apparently this is the place to go for some good ole greasy soul food .
today , i was beyond disappointed .
the service was a _num_ .
after i told her my order she repeated something completely different .
she laid it down and walked off .
never have i ever actually left a restaurant and not left a tip .
i did not leave a tip .
then i waited another _num_ minutes for them to get me my food .
after receiving my food i walked back to my hotel to enjoy some bbq .
i also got mac and cheese , bbq ribs , and green beans .
do not insult your customers bc you recognize a ny accent .
i will not be going there nor will i be recommending anyone to visit .
i had the beef ribs , collards , and mashed potatoes .
no bueno .
my boyfriend had the salmon patties which he said were just ok .
overall i was underwhelmed and disappointed .
i got the fried chicken with greens and beans .
the chicken was crispy and to die for .
the greens were just succulent .
however , we will not be back .
a long wait and not being greeted at the door for about _num_ minutes .
the only thing that was remotely redeeming was the cornbread , that was good .
how this place got _num_ stars out of _num_ i 'll never know .
needless to say i did not get to .
i was beyond put off by this and thought it to be very unprofessional !
they were not that busy at all .
such a shame .
however , on my second visit we had terrible service .
the mac and cheese and cornbread was all we ate .
it took _num_ minutes for our food to be brought out to us .
we were not pleased and will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again .
the rice was bland and the dish over all had no spice .
i had visiting family and they tried to sit us at separate tables ?
this is unacceptable for any restaurant !
my recommendation is to go elsewhere and save yourself the trouble !
i ordered chicken wings as an appetizer ... ummm that was definitely a given !
the chicken wings were delivered nice and hot , crispy but lacking in flavor .
the macaroni and cheese ... well it was mostly cheese and not much macaroni .
so overall , i was super disappointed with our lunch at mert 's .
staff was n't very friendly .
not awful but there has to be better places with southern home cooking !
the peaches were n't even sweet .
on her worst day her cooking never tasted this bad .
food was just ok , nothing special .
i ordered the salmon cakes with mac & cheese and yams .
the yams were suppose to be candied yams but were very bland .
it took about _num_ minutes before we even got our drinks .
my boyfriend ordered shrimp and grits .
i ordered the fried catfish plate with macaroni & cheese and collard greens .
the macaroni & cheese tasted like off brand cheese mixed with heavy butter .
my collard greens was way too salty .
all the other food seems very commercial and lacks flavor .
and you must be willing to overlook the horrible service as well .
i want to give this place no stars but it 's not an option .
i then ordered the fried chicken , collard greens and mac & cheese .
the service is really bad .
it 's ridiculous .
been here twice and each time slow slow service .
the food ( breakfast ) was ok .
very bland .
the chicken was flavorless tasted like flour .
the worst fried chicken ever .
the beans and rice were not much better .
my mom had a fried shrimp po ' boy with mac and cheese .
dessert we split a slice of german chocolate cake .
i recently visited mert 's for a brunch date and was so excited .
i ordered the french toast with the western omelette and home fries .
i ordered the fried catfish along with yams & mac n ' cheese .
so disappointed ... .
my fiance had ribs that were mostly fat and gristle .
this is n't it .
id give _num_ 1/2 stars .
no thanks .
not impressed .
ordered oj , they did n't have it , charged us for it anyway .
turkey was not cooked ( raw inside ) .
what a waste !
i was sadly disappointed .
the pork chops were super thin and dry .
my colleague ordered the chicken fingers with mac and cheese and collard greens .
while her sides were delicious she thought the chicken fingers missed the mark .
i tired this place because people raved about their food .
when we arrived the hostess was very unpleasant .
when our food arrived , my collard greens had tomatoes and onions .
the person i was with , asked the server for gravy .
i would never go back to this place .
the service was terrible and the food was not all that great .
as for the food .
the collard greens were hard , crunchy and gritty .
quite frankly they were disgusting .
salmon cakes were just ok .
if you are in search of soul food , i would look elsewhere .
i follow drive diner dives he raved about this place .
but you must pay to park .
ordered the chopped bbq , mac n cheese and yams .
food was not worth the wait .
will not go there again !
avoid this place at all costs .
the chicken wings were absolutely horrid .
there was no flavor , and the skin was not crispy .
the shrimp grits was disgusting as well .
the rice was too dry , and there was barely any flavor .
i am incredibly horrified by this place and will never come back .
unfortunately , mert 's is a failure to the soul food world .
the service was n't horrible , it was just slow .
the cabbage was decent , but my cabbage looked moldy , yikes !
the macaroni and cheese was old and dry .
i am completely disappointed .
will not return and i do n't recommend you waste your money here .
this place has an overall _num_ star review for a reason .
collard greens had to be the worst i have ever had .
my salad was serviced in a tea cup plate .
my first ... ... .
the food was substandard at best .
i ordered beef ribs that were more fat than meat .
and the vegetables just did n't have a clean taste to them .
but boy oh boy was i completely disappointed in my meal !
we should 've just went some where else .
my boyfriend ordered the salmon creole with cabbage and a garden salad .
he was n't satisfied at all .
so my meal was the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and cabbage .
but the beef ribs were okay and so were the side .
it was just okay nothing special at all !
we both left full but totally unsatisfied .
the menu was very very small .
this place was southern food with zero flavor or heat .
walked in and the hostess was talking to someone she knew .
so we make our decisions .
we get the drinks and never see him again .
we waited _num_ minutes for our food !
i asked for a glass of wine .
i sent it back and walked out .
both were awful .
it 's no where close to `` cream of '' anything .
next time , i 'll keep walking to johnny burritos .
- sandwiches are nothing special and over priced !
kettle one with soda - everyone knows that 's soda water right ?
after 5+ years a friend that `` loves '' it talked me into it .
unfortunately it will have to be another _num_ years before i try it .
no value .
chopped red onion totally overpowered .
it was almost another 20-30 minutes before he brought out our dinners .
sounds like poor kitchen line management that should be corrected .
hell 's kitchen would n't stand for it .
lucky we did n't have clients with us this evening .
the dish had fine flavor but was nothing special .
the entire experience was certainly below my expectations .
had to argue with staff that a martini does not only have two ounces !
corn bread was like cardboard .
however , the management is very lacking .
we left hungry and disappointed .
service was friendly , but slow .
i do n't think i 'll give this place another chance .
i even ate a couple and the sauces were yummy .
a super gross out peeve of mine .
we had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation .
pork chop was terrible and food was cold .
if i could give mimosa grill `` _num_ '' stars , i would .
i made a reservation with mimosa for my family 's thanksgiving meal in _num_ .
secondly , the chef had sizzling salmon on the buffet .
the rest of the food was overly heavy and greasy .
but , hey , at least i did n't gain weight over the holiday .
wrong !
atmosphere is not that unique , elevator music .
alot of better options uptown .
so , that gets a low mark in my book .
as for the brunch itself , it was very charlotte .
eggs , green beans , mac and cheese were all above par .
the prime rib was overcooked and dry .
so , this looks like a three star review .
only a half step above a chain restaurant .
the hush puppies were spot on .
for dessert i had the apple pie cheesecake .
it was not edible .
and , the food is not up to par .
but the food was not so great .
i went here for sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews .
however , i was extremely disappointed .
all the food was cold and clearly had sat around for a long time .
the servers were not friendly .
stay away unless you have extra money for cold food and bad service .
went for queens feast tonight .
my stomach has n't been right since i ate it .
which they assured me was not undercooked .
figured they could n't mess up creme brle ... .
but it was room temp and runny .
wo n't be back for dinner .
the mac and cheese was n't anything special either .
just ok food and service is not the greatest .
their chicken sandwich was ordinary and the fries came out a little cold .
as for the food , price does not fit the quality or size .
bad service , expensive food that 's average at most .
would n't recommend this place for sunday brunch .
buffet only with a limited tapas menu .
_num_ person simply sat our mimosas on the table and did n't speak .
it was _num_ at that point .
overall poor service .
which were n't anything to write home about .
i do n't know , maybe we came on an off night .
really _num_ 1/2 stars .
he looked annoyed that we stopped him and showed no level of customer experience .
horrendous service and mediocre food .
do n't even waste your time with this restaurant .
just awful in every sense of the way .
the only redeeming quality is the decor .
atmosphere was a _num_ .
service was a _num_ .
our server seemed like he was trying to drag out our order .
gave me my drink - left .
( that was about _num_ minutes in itself . )
cue _num_ minutes after that - finally received our entrees .
it was n't even a super busy night either .
i guess the kitchen staff was very slow that evening .
the food and the drink i ordered were so mediocre it 's ridiculous .
i ordered the spiced pear drink and it was terrible .
sadly , dinner tuesday evening on my most recent trip was a disappointment .
pecan crusted trout was tasteless .
a little seasoning ( salt , pepper ? )
no mushrooms .
i imagined smashed potatoes to be a bit more mashed .
the asparagus was more shaved and less than one full piece .
short rib was good but i expected a bit more juice .
our water glasses were empty and my wife wanted another cosmo .
we drove _num_ hr .
longhorn or any number of establishments are better at half the price .
came here for lunch once , did n't particularly care for it .
i will not be returning .
went here for my birthday and was so disappointed .
that 's the ultimate turn off .
wo n't be going there again .
so turned off by this club .
some chick tried to take me upstairs and charge me _num_ dollars per song !
first and last to this club .
very pricy , poor service and no contact dance .
very disappointed ... .
worst strip club i 've ever been to .
it 's $ _num_ ! ''
when you stop spending money they are off to another table .
fyi : no smoking in any bar or restaurant anywhere in north carolina .
sorry but it 's nc law .
i was very disappointed last night .
worst place ever !
avoid this place at all costs !
what they are doing is not right and needs to stop immediately .
the place sucks , and closes at _num_ am .
i get it , it 's a strip club ... but damn .
really low standards .
even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad .
i am torn on this late night pizza joint .
suggestions : clean up your unprofessional and rude staff !
to me , it 's just your average , run of the mill pizza .
other than that , this place is grimy , creepy , and nasty .
slices are so bland and bad .
nothing special here .
they would n't give me a water for a dollar .
ate the pizza dry as shit .
when we called , she was informed that we did get the wings .
ordered at order here sign .
cashier asks me to repeat my order to him .
what a bunch of idiots .
upon arriving the service was ridiculous .
rude , short with customers and overall just made my pickup not pleasant .
how do you mess up a slice of cheese pizza .
and now i realize why i only come here after a night of drinking .
the uptown location is awful .
we ordered wings , bbq chicken pizza ( no onions ) and garlic knots .
the estimated arrival time was _num_ minutes .
another _num_ minutes later and our order finally showed up .
disgusting .
the terrible service or the endless amount of disrespect ?
the buffalo chicken sub was yummy but cold .
anyway , the second time i came here was with my boyfriend .
the place is very cozy .
drinks are at least $ _num_ a pop .
unfortunately the food was far from impressive .
the dinner ( some kind of fish ) was salty .
i found a long blond hair in my fish .
the waiter comp my meal out .
in conclusion ... yea ... we 're not coming back .
my husband and i went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed .
our waiter was not very attentive .
we both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok .
it was not impressive .
overall we were very disappointed , especially with the good reviews we had read .
we will not go back .
and that is not a compliment .
we did not want a full bottle as we were headed to the theater .
then came the worst main courses ever !
the pasta itself was good , but the sauce ruined everything .
we were so disappointed .
the food is good but nothing to write home about .
what is worse is the food is bland .
they way we were greeted was unacceptable .
the food is terrible ... .
so why would you love it ?
me `` okay ... i guess ? ''
i got no lettuce tomatoes etc as i requested .
this place only exists because of its prime downtown location .
we skip by it now .
shame as it was one of our favorites .
internet access was $ _num_ for every _num_ hours .
parking was $ _num_ .
breakfast ( mediocre food ) was $ _num_ .
room service food was overpriced .
left feeling like it was not a good deal at all .
i will look for a more hospitable hotel next time i 'm in charlotte .
there was not a single knock or a phone call .
would n't the lobby call or knock on my door ?
manager did not even offer to comp my _num_ hour stay either !
terrible way to start my vacation !
clean rooms .
one star .
it 's only because they wo n't let me give it zero stars .
needless to say i have crossed all hilton hotels off my traveling list .
just an all around poor experience and i will not be back .
none of this was provided upon arrival .
the staff was very unhelpful .
there is no valet .
i was unhappy with my room upon arrival .
the desk staff immediately found me another room .
i finally settled in my room , which was ok - nothing special .
i walked to find dinner .
options were limited - subway and chinese food .
i would not stay here again .
grossly overpriced .
if there were _num_ stars that 's the rating this place would get .
and why is this place called an `` irish pub '' ?
but most of the time this place just falls flat .
the bartender downstairs was extremely rude .
i will not be returning .
needless to say , i will not be going back to this place .
i 'm not sure i 'd call them a deli .
not by a long shot .
they have food , and they even have subs , but a deli ?
service was n't too hot .
but it was n't very good .
the meat itself was dry - anyone can get greasy burgers .
possibly the worst in town .
i wanted them to , but they just did n't .
drinks : their drink specials are nothing to write home about .
$ _num_ for a warm corona ?
do n't waste your time and money .
not the place to be .
crowd was dull .
this place is terrible , never go here ever .
it took an hour to get my mediocre wings .
music was awful last saturday .
made the beer in plastic taste worse .
i was really excited to checkout brixx .
_num_ minutes later , we finally got his attention to request the bill .
salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing .
the pizzas my husband and i ordered were mediocre .
the waitress was so impatient .
from there it only went downhill .
she did n't come back to the table after that for _num_ minutes .
meh ... i do n't get it .
brixx just did n't do it for me .
but that 's where the good stops ... unfortunately .
and for me i 'd rather pay more to get better tasting food .
i did n't like the crust , or the sauce and it arrived lukewarm .
ugh .
i might not have liked the wood fried pizza .
brixx is not the case !
my wife 's cheese pizza was like wet cardboard .
all in all , i 've found better things to spend $ _num_ on .
he did not agree that wifi for customers was a good idea .
he thought they would `` stay too long '' .
one word , ugh .
dirty floor , cardboard pizza .
few times i was incorrectly charged and impossible to get corrected .
unfortunately , that 's where the good stuff ends .
the gym facilities are atrocious .
also , what kind of idiot buys bottled water as a gift ?
the in house internet is the slowest you will find .
the location is also horrible .
i got precious few hours sleep that night !
i just know that it created a roaring sound in my room .
as you may have guessed , this did not happen .
despite their best effort , no cab was there .
i just was n't impressed !
i showed him my coupon , and asked him if he accepted them .
negative experience # _num_ :
my girlfriend walked here to get change for laundry .
the steak is average and it 's over run by boa middle management .
go for the top tier steak ... steer clear of apps .
the service here was very sub-par .
my husband likes steak , but -- - i want to eat healthy .
i had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk .
ugh .
oh , i wo n't be coming back .
sadly it was not .
potato gratin ( $ _num_ ) needed an extra _num_ min .
grilled asparagus ( $ _num_ ) it was ok ... but just ok .
eating in the best restaurants in town and when we travel is not unusual .
the calamari and the mozzarella wrapped cheese .
the rest of us ordered the mixed field greens salad which was awful .
none of us even finished half the portion .
even my _num_ year old recognized the poor quality of meat .
my wife had the salmon which was better than the filet but nothing exciting .
the creme brulee and flourless chocolate cake for desert were both amazing .
i would recommend just hitting the bar for these late night after a show .
the service was also only marginal .
i was extremely disappointed with capital grille .
i would have expect better quality of food for a _num_ star restaurant .
this place is terrible .
we will never return to this establishment for a meal again .
for starters i got the mozzarella basil tomato salad .
but that is not what you go to a steakhouse for .
the service was more awkward than attentive .
my family and i were out for a very special occasion .
apologizing of course , but still uncomfortable .
it turned out mostly mediocre .
do not fall for the hype .
i made reservations for nye probably around _num_ weeks in advance .
it was all downhill from there .
that did not matter since we were _num_ years younger than every other patron .
i should 've known better .
overly intrusive server did n't help .
service was very awkward , like i was his first table -- ever .
i doubt i will ever set foot in this place again .
the balsamic whatever sirloin was awful .
literally the worst steak i 've had in a year or two .
still waiting on more phone calls to be returned .
i also ordered a jerk chicken sandwich .
cold cold cold .
either way , i am not taking the chance again with this place .
not that the food was bad , mind you .
it was just meh .
chicken was a bit dry .
not enough gooey cheesy saucy mess .
now that would have been an improvement .
the worst food ever .
there was no mention of cheese on the menu for the meal .
hands down , not worth your time or money !
slow service ( even though we were the only customers in place ) .
and let us not forget the worst restrooms ever .
do n't waste your time or money !
but beyond that , total meh .
the food is not very special at all .
each day they also have a $ _num_ lunch special .
generic , but what else do you expect from most downtown businesses .
service was nice , the place was fairly empty .
this is what knocked the 3rd star off .
overall not a bad experience .
get your shit together .
should always tip cause they do n't really get paid by the restaurant .
sundays paper sometimes is no bigger than a big city 's week day paper .
guess i got spoiled by the washington post .
nothing happens .
so now i am out $ _num_ and never got a paper .
the paper got thinner and thinner for a city the size of charlotte .
finally ... this fee based to get news online is a complete joke .
i tried paying my bill online .
so i called on monday to get a real person .
so why does my bill say different .
i did not have one of those .
paper ripped or shredded , give it to them anyway .
they never fix the problem , or attempt to make it right .
it is expensive .
everyone hates it and they do n't care about their community .
he was diligent and never had a problem for _num_ years .
did not receive another paper until july 6th .
made numerous phone calls and emails saying the problem was being addressed .
it is a crap shoot do i get the paper ?
sounds sorta like stealing , does n't it ?
called manager twice only to leave voicemail .
customer service is not even located in this country .
signed up to have daily paper and never received _num_ paper .
i 've been on hold for _num_ minutes so far .
this is the 6th time i 've called them about the same issue .
these people are unbelievable !
voicemail is all you get with no returned calls by the way !
ugh worst serves ever !
besides , one can google any recipe online for free .
called manager twice only to leave voicemail .
customer service is not even located in this country .
update !
and all they do is apologize but ca n't solve any problems .
did not get the thanksgiving day paper that i paid extra for either .
it was just not worth the aggravation any longer .
that would have been the wife and she would have said hell no !
i did n't even answer them back .
the rating is a zero !
worst paper on the planet .
major fail !
we made a reservation ( no need ) for 7pm on saturday .
second best my margarita ( s ) that our server made was awesome !
gross !
all in all this meal was just sad !
she then brings out the salmon ... gosh that poor friend who ordered salmon .
disappointed is an understatement .
i will not be back .
the worst service ever .
avoid this place at all costs .
the food is disgusting .
i honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life .
do n't bother with this place .
waited about _num_ - _num_ minutes .
avoid at all costs .
do n't bother going .
so i left .
horrible business model .
thanks but no thanks .
nothing in charlotte is that special for me to go through all that .
no joke , not polite , or friendly just rude and a jerk .
they only allow certain tiny bags in or clear plastic bags .
are u kidding me $ _num_ for a mediocre meal !
tried chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed .
i always notice that chicks is super slow .
the food was not good however .
the lo mien tasted way too greasy and was flavorless .
the chicken tasted like mystery meat .
the smell from when i got the food was just not appetizing .
only two stars due to the lack of selection .
$ _num_ car bomb shots !
other than that , they really do n't have any other specials .
the selection here is horrible .
trash .
oh , i forgot , the piss is also really expensive .
upstairs and outside areas are tight too .
seems ridiculous and all about $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ !
immediately walking in you are struck by a smell .
lots of tables and benches or chairs .
they even had corn hole .
the vibe felt kind of lame , it was n't for me .
never again well i spend money in this establishment .
the smell of urine when you walk in is overwhelming .
and the jersey - boy bartenders have major attitude .
not an authentic irish bar , by any means .
i felt really unwelcome the entire time i was in the store .
this is not the customer service i would expect at a high end jeweler .
called this morning to check about the watch .
no one call me at all .
run away if you could this place just straight up ridiculous terrible .
i wish if i can even remove the _num_ star rating .
the bread was stale , and after waiting _num_ minutes i was definitely disappointed .
well my reuben had barely had any meat and no _num_ island dressing .
the bread was soggy and you could not even tell it was toasted .
my wife ordered a chicken salad on pita , minus lettuce and tomatoes .
the bagels here are n't as good as everyone said they would be .
avoid at all costs .
minus _num_ star for that .
well , not so much .
they lacked the variety of bagels and cream cheeses i am used to seeing .
as we all know bagels are n't the easiest breads to bite .
i just need to avoid bagel sandwiches ... .
if you 're in a hurry , do n't come here .
very slow .
i 've been standing in line for _num_ min .
he could n't remember what i ordered .
if you 're in a hurry do n't come here .
i would hire any number of them at any time .
their most recent management change has left the place without a soul .
the service is lousy .
horrible .
same sandwhich never costs the same price .
sad , cause i always was a fan of this company .
terrible service .
good bagels , but it had horrible customer service .
this is really frustrating , especially at this time of day .
the garden veggie soup is watery , not recommended .
that may be an exaggeration , but probably not .
i do n't need this , seriously .
i will not be going back again .
oh , how i wish there was a good seafood restaurant here !
will not go back .
not a bad place but there are many others in charlotte that are better .
so if you are looking for atmosphere , not your place .
i did n't see the hostesses smiled once during the meal .
the bisque was lukewarm at best .
the chocolate cake was cold & hard .
either way , i wo n't be coming back .
he had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant .
i had the stuffed shrimp , he had the almond crusted tilapia .
the stuffed shrimp was way too salty and a little fishy .
the tilapia was a complete opposite !
no salt at all !
now i 'm unable to get the points on my reservation .
so unfortunate .
my tuna was cold and was not cooked well .
steak was over cooked .
atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale .
and just walked off .
our waiter was in no hurry to take care of us .
every single bite was perfection !
drop the bad attitude and step it up .
there are load of other upscale establishments in charlotte that get it done .
the experience was nothing close to nice or upscale .
kevin had lobster pasta and i had steak .
waiter no where in sight , i flag down someone for a steak knife .
a couple minutes later a guy comes by with our desserts .
aside from that , the desserts were good .
just nothing to write home about .
i asked for a mount and balance from them and had a good laugh .
they did the same service for $ _num_ .
after visiting this location once , i will not be back .
a few simple items turned into a large bill .
i thought the charges were excessive and questionable services that they stated i needed .
not again for me .
do not take your car here unless you want something messed up !
these guys are the worst shop in charlotte .
they scratched my car .
typical auto repair shop trying to steal money especially from young women .
greyhound is a nightmare !
they charged $ _num_ because i was buying the ticket for someone else .
avoid the dirty dog if you can !
as bus stations go this one is pretty neat , tidy and clean .
if only the free wifi worked more than it did n't .
yes it 's true greyhound really needs to train their employees higher customer satisfaction .
this station lacked in communication in every way possible !
ugh unreal and frustrated to the tee !
is n't that your job ?
and i was denied priority boarding .
but , they act as though i 've asked for the world .
i wish that i did n't have to give this location even one star .
the staff at both locations where the hell did they find them .
that 's not how you treat people .
lazy workers , all rude and incompetent .
you 're job is not at the least bit difficult .
this place is horrible .
it also reeks of a unpleasant scent .
it was a nightmare .
ridiculous i will never patronize again .
kind of service that screams for a _num_ % tip .
somehow still managed to spend _num_ bucks a head .
the downstairs [ outside of our group ] was dead .
on the outside , it looks like a corner business .
to add insult to injury , they try to play the club vibe outside .
drink price : $ _num_ for a beer .
would i go here again ?
it was terrible .
the the service was okay and i was atmosphere was not that great .
i do not see myself returning .
not impressed .
if i am ever in charlotte again i will find another place to eat .
i went back again for half off appetizers , and was horribly disappointed .
for a fri night , the service was slow .
not enough staff .
no wonder empty on friday night .
but food and drinks were disappointing .
it was not a busy night so it was a bit disappointing .
i will not go back .
this was the worst restaurant experience i 've ever had .
at this point we had n't complained .
she added _num_ % gratuity , which was when we asked for a manager .
the manager on duty never stopped by or said anything .
i will not be back .
also , do n't leave fast food on a table in the dining area .
it 's not sanitary .
very very disappointed by how this place accompanied us .
so with that said i 'm not sure i would be back .
very disappointing to say the least .
prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat .
a lobster and seafood sub that tasted like a salt and seafood sub .
cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich .
after five minutes of not seeing any hostess , we left .
the second time , we visited in the afternoon for lunch .
needless to say , the one hostess on duty never returned .
and she never acknowledged us previously either .
do n't go there if you 're looking for a quick lunch .
very slow internet .
as for the accommodations themselves , it is your typical hampton , nothing fancy .
i really would not recommend staying here unless there was nothing else available .
if you 're anything else , there are better options in uptown .
dirty and nasty .
this is the place for wan na be steelers fans .
the waitresses were very rude and didnt care about your orders .
not sure about this place .
not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed .
just not my kind of place .
there really was n't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible .
it never seems that clean .
drink specials are a scam , no price listed on their specialty drinks .
no reason to go to this place , spend your money elsewhere .
ridiculous !
they do not watch the dance floor which is dj lesson # _num_ .
but not in a good way .
i could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left .
the only reason we left was because we felt entirely , completely unwelcome .
it 's just a worn out place .
the floor was so sticky i do n't see how anyone was really dancing .
they do n't even really serve breakfast .
do not live here .
my roommate and i recently just moved out and had a terrible experience .
our lease ended on april 3rd and everything went smoothly .
completely unacceptable .
i would strongly advise against living here .
we had carpet , and the oldest , white appliances i have ever seen .
not only am i a professional , but i work two jobs .
i 'm in bed before 8pm on most nights .
it was the most absurd thing i 've ever heard .
the parking in this place is ridiculous .
maybe it 's just the other buildings that are awful ... who knows .
in fact , i advised a friend against living here .
this place was by far the worst place i 've ever lived .
do not go here if you want quick service .
also very over priced .
very poor customer service .
there are too many options in uptown .
i will not try them again .
worst customer service , even by post office standards !
and plus your going to be in line for _num_ minutes anyways .
you should just go to fedex where they gladly accept your patronage .
in addition , it seems a little pricey for what they offer .
disgusting , slow and pathetic .
we waited _num_ minutes for one sub and it ended up being pretty bad .
there was almost no meat on it and the bread was a little stale .
there luckily was a subway up the street .
i would not recommend this cleaner .
clothes were n't pressed correctly & they 're expensive .
on a positive note , they did n't lose any of my items ... .
it 's a convenience store , like walgreens or cvs .
when someone came in , they gave a bland generic greeting .
it felt awkward to be there .
this one feels a bit old , dated and run down .
the room was not very nice .
musty smelling .
bathroom was not up to par to the price of the room .
wireless connection at this place is horrible .
however , staff was nice and accommodating .
probably not .
westin would be a better choice for a little more money .
i was hoping to have a similar experience and was thoroughly disappointed .
i would hate it , but she likes a firm mattress .
hallways and rooms were dim , though the beds were comfortable .
furniture was very dated .
rooms were not quiet to say the least .
i 'll stay elsewhere next time i 'm in town .
parking nightmare .
i 'm sorry but that is a personal pet peeve .
b. you just told me there were no stairs to this exit .
our room overlooked the pool , and some of charlotte .
bad lighting .
terrible .
i thought it was going to rip my skin off .
if we were to stay in uptown again we would stay elsewhere .
for the price this is a _num_ star .
for location this place is a _num_ star .
i would hate to see what a normal room looks like .
tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug .
poor design .
lots of other hotel choices in the area .
when we complained to the hotel they only switched our room .
not even an apology note .
painfully blah , older business hotel that needs updates and upgrades .
room decor is old and bed was not comfortable .
tv was newer , but remote was terrible .
the ritz ... and then what ?
the walls and doors are paper thin .
we will not be staying here again .
everything was more or less ok except for the noise .
otherwise you will not get a good night 's sleep .
you should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise .
gross !
i can not believe my experience with this hotel .
the chair in the room was extremely dirty and stained .
it is the worst room i have ever stayed in ever .
we only stayed one night .
the whole experience was awful and uncomfortable .
-the cable tv went out every _num_ minutes .
-the room was just dingy .
this hotel left so much to be desired , sadly .
walked in and smelled the musty smell that other yelpers described .
the water pressure was borderline painful and the shower head was very low .
the bed was hard as rocks and very uncomfortable .
nothing was done to accommodate the crappy situation unfortunately .
this hotel is extremely loud and the walls are very thin .
word to the wise : steer clear of this dump .
however , my room was foul .
there is limited items for those looking for a healthy diet .
will not be my choice for future stays in charlotte .
this was my first trip to charlotte .
ripped curtains , blown out light bulbs in bathroom .
i switched it to another outlet , and , again , no charge .
i called room service , and they never brought them up .
it continued for two hours .
the garbage cans on site were overflowing with garbage for two days .
we were really disappointed in this hotel and will not be returning at all .
made a reservation in may through expedia , which i needed to cancel .
sure , i wrote that down and remembered it _num_ months later .
so , obviously will not be staying there on future visits to charlotte .
complete disappointment !
completely disappointed .
this ruined my anniversary !
the makeup mirror was hanging off the wall ready to fall .
smallest bathroom ever for a hotel i 've stayed in .
it 's tired and needs a major overhaul .
this place is soon so gross .
the carpet has clearly not been cleaned since it was installed .
that 's such an easy fix , it just shows they do n't care .
so gross .
the parking situation is weird so make sure you valet .
also , do n't waste your time with the wifi .
i vote anywhere else .
if you are lucky turn down service will happen .
instead i felt really ripped off .
everything else screamed _num_ .
actually all of the staff i encountered in my _num_ days here were great .
however , the actual hotel room was very disappointing .
the room had a very strong musty smell and was not the cleanest .
the bed and pillows were both very firm and uncomfortable .
the bathroom door did n't close over the rug that was on the floor .
the rooms are just worn out and in mighty need of a facelift .
stay away , there are many better options downtown .
wo n't be back .
loud music until like _num_ am .
they suggested i move rooms but none would be quiet ?
no thanks .
i had to wait in the lobby for hours .
i agree with previous reviewers ... going downhill fast .
wifi , another $ _num_ ( $ _num_ ) to be exact .
needless to say , i would n't stay here again if you paid me .
walls are very thin and you can hear casual conversations of guests next door .
this was my 9th time in charlotte for business .
wish i would have read yelp first .
wifi costs _num_ bucks a night .
valet another _num_ .
the bathroom is total trash .
go for drinks , eat elsewhere .
this place is closed _num_ years ago .
there 's not really an opportunity for any of that at this place .
contact lenses over-priced .
reviewers , we will be looking for another provider for these services .
terrible service and experience !
i am very disappointed and upset right now .
i always tend to see the glass half full , not empty .
but today , i think i have had enough with this place .
nothing has changed .
no call to update me or explain the delay .
get them in , get them out .
screw me over once , shame on you .
shame on me .
shame on me .
blood pressure reading was input in my chart before taking my blood pressure .
spent $ _num_ on a new pair of glasses and they did n't fit .
mistakes happen , i get it , but three strikes and your out .
i was advised by maria that they will come from italy .
the pair never was ordered .
they sent the original glasses off to be filled .
when it was addressed , maria stated she will order again .
my expectations would have been set and i just would have went somewhere else .
our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst i can remember !
i called over the waiter and explained .
avoid this restaurant !
some of the worst customer service i 've ever experienced .
guess that 's worth _num_ stars eh ?
this place is downright bizarre .
the salad was just alright , nothing terribly impressive .
i do n't know much about about french food so i was curious .
and , crab soup so salty , was not edible .
will not be going there again .
i did n't like it and i probably wo n't be back .
very confused by this spot .
it is simply a greek restaurant called french quarter .
everything else ... so-so .
very busy with short wait times .
very loud too .
difficult to hold conversations .
seating too close together .
soup was mediocre .
i 'm totally confused .
not falling for the trick .
terrible selection , rude !
the whole area was pretty rude .
all in all bad experience will never go back due to the rude staff .
was n't overly impressed with the food or beer selection .
not really sure why they call this place the french quarter .
nothing about the menu items say louisiana or french quarter .
my family ordered the bacon burger , chicken fingers , and a greek wrap .
no real kids menu .
the food was very tasty , waitress was very cordial .
the decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired .
ok no biggie , but then came the food .
let me just get your drink orders . ''
i ordered seared ahi tuna salad .
even so , the service was adequate - nothing more , nothing less .
not very friendly and welcoming , just adequate .
sides are ordered separately ; we selected grilled asparagus and potato gratin .
the portions are quite generous but the presentation was way off for me .
the chunks of clay on the wall are interesting , i guess .
i liked the salad , but it was nothing special .
the consistency of the blue crab fondue was a little too runny .
the little copper pot it came in was cool though .
at $ _num_ , i was not impressed .
one more time she came out and honestly i was getting pissed off .
they had no baked potatoes .
so , i just asked her , what do you have .
mashed potatoes was my only choice .
for $ _num_ , they ca n't find i potato ?
the steak was served on top of the overly buttered mash potatoes .
i ate them , but nothing special .
after $ _num_ for _num_ people , i was not impressed .
as the website states , with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes .
false advertisement .
left in _num_ minutes and booked room across the street at la quinta .
wish i could have given red roof a quarter of a star .
do n't stay here .
it 's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy .
my room was smoke free yet it reeked of smoke and a horrible smell .
i will never return to red roof in .
_num_ came and went and no shuttle .
the shuttle driver claimed he was never told about a _num_ pickup .
i would n't recommend at all parking your car there for the airport .
room does not look like hotels.com photos .
do not stay here .
probably the worst hotel ever .
something fishy is def going on here .
worst hotel !
this is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing .
she asks me what i ordered .
my sandwich was dripping with sauce and had everything on it !
she turned out to be the only pleasant person during my whole experience .
was the fourth car in line and have been sitting here for _num_ minutes .
now i wait at the menu with no response ... .
wo n't be back .
worst experience ever at a wendy 's !
my daughter 's drink order was wrong to start .
then it took forever to get our burgers .
while we wait our fries are sitting on b the tray getting cold .
once we received our burgers one was wrong .
after getting it corrected my fries were then really cold .
i asked for ketchup and was handed _num_ packets .
avoid this location if you can .
every other experience there was nearly as bad .
my friend was transferred to this hospital from the south park emergency room .
they kept her there for _num_ nights which is unheard of .
they took a ct scan but we never received results , still have n't .
the nurse said nothing and just kept going .
i am not sure how someone thinks this food is great .
it is subpar and out of the freezer .
nothing is homemade and food is dry .
grocery stores are always open .
( sigh ) ... so here 's why i 'll never shop here again .
so i 'm reading the back .
then i see it : `` this finished product not tested on animals . ''
and then i just got mad .
do they think we are idiots ?
excuse the rant , but this just really pissed me off .
restaurant had a horrible cleaned my smell as well .
worst service i have ever had two visits in a row .
our waiter was awful .
had to track down another server twice for drink refills and our check .
rude employees .
will not be back to that location !
but when it came out it just looked like a bowl of lard .
it also felt like i was eating a bowl of lard .
i should have probably ordered from the diet menu .
have n't had this bad of an experience in a while .
service was extremely slow .
hit and miss for lunch and summer .
pathetic , no other way to describe this brunch .
i did have breakfast here once before and it was n't this bad .
i stop her from running off because the food looks suspicious .
sure enough the poached eggs were hard boiled .
it 's been _num_ minutes since i first ordered .
sad to say , this was a big mistake .
food : sub-par for your money .
free bread : none .
food : sub-par for your money .
free bread : none .
i felt like i was asking an enemy for a favor .
never use this place .
do not recommend .
hard to believe how they stay in business .
i am very upset and disappointed with the service that i have received .
now , almost two weeks later , my order still has not arrived .
the customer service is not what i expected .
these books were needed last friday for a class that meets on mondays .
this is unacceptable .
would n't go back .
but then he asks if he can see the earrings and necklace .
sadly that is n't the end .
i 've worked in the jewelry business , and i know what i like .
i was very clear in the preferences i stated .
you do n't tell a customer what to like .
that 's unacceptable .
oh but that 's not all folks .
if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !
if there were zero stars i would give that rating instead !
anyway , we were dropping off three rings .
seriously , and it gets much worse .
and turn around and walk the hell out of there , seriously .
horrible customer service .
how rude !
this is the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
not a way to gain a new customer !
my wife then confirmed her day off from work .
i 'd give this company zero stars if it were an option .
they came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem .
when two weeks go by , i called to check in .
no one answered the phone during business hours .
neither of our messages were returned .
the worst customer service ever !
probably the least professional business i 've ever worked with .
on the 2nd load every it refused to turn off .
first go around - not too bad .
the owner was beyond rude !
made many promises and failed to keep them .
claimed his repair guy was out of cell range all day .
very rude and unprofessional guy !
not willing to work out anything with the customer .
he did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time .
would not recommend this company to anyone .
zero stars for this guy .
my home warranty company gave me the number to carolina appliance service .
i assume he was the owner because he said `` my company '' .
that is ridiculous !
i will not be working with carolina appliance service again .
its consistent , bad service or lack there of .
well that 's sure different , way to waste money on that .
the store itself is fairly clean and generic .
there was no voicemail option .
i have never in my life encountered such awful customer service .
we will never use sam 's club again .
i am so sick of walmart and sam 's club associates .
both walmart and sam 's club need to learn valuable customer service .
customer service is a joke .
horrible customer service !
said something to manager and they did n't care .
extremely rude .
completely ripped me off .
everything else is nasty .
go back to florida , they like it there .
bland bbq , bland chicken .
this location was kind of busy .
we still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order .
when she came back and had nothing i gave up .
he knew he had issues , bad people and a huge problem .
i visited around lunch time and the food was not that good .
the entree was a dry .
i am sorry , but i wo n't be back .
i do n't know where to start .
god turned water into wine well i will never be back .
i drove past this place on almost a daily basis for a couple years .
when our food finally arrived it was a disappointment .
my brisket was completely dry , as was the cornbread .
the baked potato was overcooked and the beans super sweet with no smoke .
corn bread just taste bad .
it is n't worth it and is n't typical for the south .
do n't eat here !
do not recommend .
so go thee instead .
i visited nc and thought this place was disgusting , i sure was right !
never ever going back .
my experiences have not been satisfactory at all .
save yourself the frustration !
i have never received worse customer service .
and she has been rude and nasty to me since .
i really could care less at the moment .
anyway , appointment starts and we go into separate room .
every vet i 've been to takes the temp through her ear .
it seemed a little rough .
do n't you do this all day ?
could n't you have told me to move ?
overall , kind of an irritating experience .
the staff did n't seem to `` get '' dogs .
i do not recommend south charlotte animal hospital .
i came in for my first visit and was very disappointed .
the nurse was very short with me .
what animal hospital does not stock those items ?
for an annual , the price was outrageous .
i will not be returning .
they did my cuticles so badly that i was bleeding a whole lot .
do n't bother making an appointment for this place .
that goes for the dated , smelly theater as well .
on this beautiful friday evening there was no ticket office open .
never fear , she sold us a ticket .
it 's terrible .
she poured me a _num_ oz pour and charged me around $ _num_ .
this theatre is dying , do n't waste your money .
this place is filthy and outdated .
the bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone !
nasty !
as for their food options , they 're not great .
that was _num_ minutes of my life that i 'd like back .
the food sucks and is way overpriced as is the souvenirs .
we had no problems using our admission ticket or parking ticket .
the snack was another problem .
skip this .
- workers : rude , rude , rude .
are you kidding me ?
do n't buy your tickets online !
staffs are disrespectful and do n't want to help at all .
lines are short and fast because the place is near empty .
most we had to wait was _num_ minutes .
specific problem is the incredibly poor customer service attitude .
poor , poor customer service .
wow just really bad .
carowinds in my opinion is crap .
poor customer service in all parts of the park .
managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it .
carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money .
im done w this place .
first parking is a joke and a crime .
this is n't just for premium parking , but its for general too .
some of the bathrooms were really old and disgusting .
should have wait times listed for rides .
staff is n't polite or even nice for that matter .
park is n't very clean .
bathrooms are filthy and smell awful .
i would not recommend purchasing extras online .
only purchase the basic tickets .
we had a printed voucher that we paid for that was n't honored .
$ _num_ mistake ( _num_ people ) .
nowhere on the dinosaur tickets we purchased does it say anything about that time !
last saturday , i paid for my ticket and headed in .
no .
- $ _num_ for chicken tenders and fries ?
no other entertainment was available while we were there .
wo n't make the _num_ hour drive again from charleston .
much better value for money spent .
wrong !
saving up that six hundred bucks to go elsewhere .
park was beyond rude and unhelpful about it .
food is expensive and nasty .
when we finally got off after your employees gave zero communication .
it was a waste of my day time and money .
it 's sad when a park can only give you a drink for compensation .
however , it 's not worth it here .
it took one kid _num_ minutes to refill our drink .
it 's miserable . ''
carowinds has horrible line management .
on top of that , my boyfriend and i encountered the rudest staff there .
avoid this place if you have the option .
they should be closed down for good and removed from the park .
_num_ cents ?
what is really bad is the food was horrible !
really , you do n't know the answer to that simple question ?
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
the customer service is atrocious .
ummm ... excuse me !
if anything goes wrong you 'll get the worst help ever .
i 'm very disappointed with the way carowinds is run .
all the employees were extremely rude and seemed to hate their jobs .
one employee yelled at me and my dad for nothing !
never have i had these problems at carowinds until this year !
so sad carowinds has become such a disappointment .
plus do n't even try complaining to guest services .
they could care less about your complaints and then tell you some bs excuse .
we sadly left with extreme disappointment !
i will not recommend anyone to go to the park .
will not go back to carowinds !
unfortunately , we recently had a very disappointing experience at carowinds .
the line was over three hours long .
it was not , it was also almost three hours long as well .
cindy , the manager on duty , was rude from the beginning .
she had no response and again told us we were essentially out of luck .
drove _num_ hours to get to the park .
still charging $ _num_ plus $ _num_ for parking .
i would definitely not take your family .
i would give _num_ stars if i could .
worst experience of my families life .
then tons of school kids were breaking lines and nothing being done .
ridiculous .
check your credit and debit cards after use in carowinds !
kids and even adults were so annoyed and started cutting lines .
same with food , souvenirs and entrance tickets .
my husband and i just moved to charlotte and live about _num_ mins away .
the worst .
we only spent maybe _num_ mins in that line .
then our day took a turn for the worse .
we did n't get to ride that .
do n't get excited like i did .
did n't see it till we had already taken drinks .
so , i am really really disappointed carowinds .
worst food ever got sick .
i been here before then said you can sit down now .
so these guys almost made me spend $ _num_ for unnecessary repairs .
the manager then pushed a full set of tires my way for $ _num_ .
worst place ever .
for nothing i needed !
duke energy is the only electric company in town .
their customer service is terrible .
five days later i get a bill for three previous months !
they asked if i was sure i only moved in five days earlier .
the company is run by morons .
if you live in the area , i guess you have no choice .
duke energy pulled some really shady crap on us .
horrible customer service .
worst experience on the phone with customer service ever !
please do not support a place that sells puppy mill dogs .
i do not recommend going here .
i was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food .
not impressed .
the woman in charge was downright rude .
do not recommend !
please do not buy fish from this store they will rip you off .
nothing more ; nothing less .
what a waste .
it 's $ _num_ a head .
finally , no one takes credit cards ... even for the admission charge .
not a good mix .
on the week ends it is $ _num_ dollars .
should have only paid per ride .
do n't really remember it being so bad when i was younger lol .
felt like someone was holding my whole body down .
hot dog was not bad but nothing to write home about .
they did have a free petting zoo and horse ride was eight dollars .
i should have let my nephew finger paint my car instead .
the guy ( tom ) , acknowledged everything i was saying .
so i dropped it off for a week .
when i picked it up : _num_ .
they did n't even paint the roof .
no body work was done .
whatever you were thinking of getting done ... do n't do it there .
there is paint on the grill and damage from where the tape was removed .
both cars left the shop looking worse than they did when they entered .
customer service leaves much to be desired .
ridiculously overpriced for the finished product and experience .
no call .
saturday rolls around , no call .
the next week starts , still no call .
over _num_ hours after they say it 'll be ready .
not ready .
entire car was dusty , inside and out .
truly the worst customer experience ever .
they do n't provide it because they do n't want you to find them .
but when i 'm on a budget i choose motel _num_ .
then to top it off the remote does n't even work for the tv .
no way to rate a _num_ !
the room smelled awful .
only _num_ towels for _num_ people !
even when we asked for more towels they said only _num_ per room .
_num_ battery in the tv remote and the phone did n't work .
i also wore my shoes in the shower because of how unsanitary it was !
this is probably the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
i was on a long trip from florida and stopped here for the night .
i wish i would have taken photos .
i have never been to a less taken care of establishment .
this hotel is old and poorly managed .
they have a sanitation rating of _num_ % .
when i got a refund the next day it was $ _num_ short !
why am i being charged for your mistakes ?
not nearly impossible , literally impossible .
my room reeked of mold and mildew .
nasty hotel !
the next room was worse .
i could not believe it .
on the 3rd floor , with no elevator in sight .
like stains from washing and not coming out of the sheets .
i had to flush like _num_ times for it to clear the bowl .
the water was very hard .
it got cold at night .
we could not leave it on while gone from the room .
the room itself was not too bad .
i would stay at a days inn again , but definitely not this one .
no customer service .
when i went in to discuss , i heard another patient checking in .
the doctor prescribed me medication that i am allergic to .
went on the visit and nothing was done .
they are lazy ass hell !
do n't waste your money or time .
find another place where the doctors care .
i do n't know what is happening to medicine patients appointments etc .
it makes me very unhappy .
horrible .
there is a reason this location has such bad reviews .
the front desk staff is the worst i 've ever encountered .
everyone else obviously hates their job and could care less about your medical problems .
avoid uptown at all costs .
because _num_ is n't an option .
extremely poor customer service .
this is `` name brand '' prices for crap clothing .
and we went over by _num_ cent !
drab drab drab .
are you kidding me ?
pay less has better !
sometimes i guess expected good customer service is asking for too much .
this is just ridiculous .
unorganized store with a smaller selection than most old navy stores .
there were clothes all over the ground and nothing was folded .
the manager was also talking with the employees in a loud and inappropriate way .
this location is not well maintained by management .
always extremely slow service and long lines .
crime is a problem !
oops , all the treadmills are occupied .
now it 's getting very ghetto .
the men 's locker room is always nasty .
the toilets are disgusting , and the sauna and steam rooms are never clean .
just cancelled and move to fitness connection for $ _num_ bucks a month .
to be fair , we knew it was pricey .
same with my ginger ale .
slow , slow , slow .
the food just was n't that great , and it was a bit pricey .
nothing wrong with paying up for great food , but blue was n't it .
however , based on previous reviews , the food is hit or miss .
my dinner there was a substantial miss for a pretty substantial price .
side note : the service was phenomenal , no problems in that department .
or if someone else is picking up the tab .
you can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again .
or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily .
also , i did n't like the quality of the flatbread .
lobster cream sauce should never be flavorless !
the cake di chocolate is standard lava cake ( takes forever to make ) .
not a fan .
maybe if i come back next time i 'll have better luck ?
i am in boston , not charlotte .
i would never patronize a place like this .
if you do , be cautious -- do not give them your email .
ok , i 'm lying .
the service was atrocious and incredibly slow .
so the food is boxed and i come home , nightmare over , right ?
wrong !
so nobody went home with their own food .
not quite horrible , but not quite good either .
edible is a better word for it .
sounds fancy , eh ?
manager : ( blank stare and walks away ) .
needless to say , i will never come back here again .
if it were free , i would probably still pass .
we were excited to dine at blue as part of restaurant week .
i could n't get the taste of char out of my mouth .
um , probably not .
i never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life .
nothing to write home about .
the duck was really rough & fatty .
i preferred them over the duck .
for dessert , we ordered the cheesecake to split .
the food was decent .
service was absolutely horrible !
the young woman did not greet us in the most welcoming manner .
she looked as if she was forced to be there !
never asked us if we wanted another drink nor if are food was good !
it was very bizarre !
for such a nice atmosphere its too bad the service was horrible .
i rarely complain but i have never been treated sooo poorly .
not impressed .
sorry we picked it after reading rave reviews online .
would n't go back .
but not the place if you 're super hungry .
the most recent time i went i was very disappointed .
i do n't know that i 'll recommend my guests here any more .
all _num_ over prices and all _num_ just okay .
and still disappointed .
pop and they were down the hatch !
_num_ star .
_num_ stars .
something tells me there is better seafood out there in charlotte .
what a disappointment , the risotto balls were very bland and gummy .
the only good thing was the lemon drop martini .
i am sorry to be writing this review .
my first visit to blue a few years ago was fabulous .
the calamari appetizer was good , but not worth $ _num_ .
the baked in house bread were blah , and butter was not offered .
but , this evening was an utter disappointment .
btw ... coffee was $ _num_ .
sorry , but i will not go back .
probably would not go back .
do not recommend .
to be honest with you nothing really jumped off the menu to me .
i settled for the beef tenderloin and fried calamari appetizer .
i ordered medium-rare and it was purple , barely cooked in the middle .
simply put , it is overpriced and not worth your money .
went for a girls night for restaurant week .
he picked the risotto balls they were okay , kinda bland .
this was not a good steak .
the cookie was terrible !
it was gross .
do n't think i will be back .
disappointed in my queens feast choice .
wish i could go back and choose again .
i 'm a foodie and disappointed .
no vegan desert option for me ( fresh fruit option , please ?
it all seemed to disappear , though , so that says something !
still , i 'm not sure we will be back anytime soon .
after being seated , it took our waiter forever to come to our table .
what a bummer to spend that much money and be that underwhelmed .
reservation for _num_ on a saturday made with ease .
maybe a warning sign .
it was also very loud .
it kind of set me off for the rest of the meal .
the service was ok , but not great .
our waters were n't refilled but once .
i waffle between _num_ stars and _num_ .
this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .
beyond that our waitress was rude .
here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .
this is a personal experience that stuck with me for years .
i consider a brunch with mom on mothers day ruined when mom is apologizing .
here i am on yelp looking at queen 's feast and i see blue .
you might love this place but i had such a poor experience and follow-up .
probably the worst mother 's day brunch in charlotte .
i felt horrible that my husband paid _num_ dollars each for basically an omelette .
the fruit was mediocre .
the salad was n't good .
the vegetable station was n't appealing .
the beef i got was so tough i could n't chew it .
there were very few vegetables to order with it .
we sure wish we had gone somewhere else .
i do n't think we will come here any time again too soon .
it 's a shame .
my husband ordered a whiskey sour and our friends and i ordered bloody marys .
i thought the menu had said tapas style for the table - my bad .
eventually i just gave up .
i asked for a cappuccino for dessert and was told the machine was broken .
mediocre food .
pretentious and overpriced .
i 'm just going to break this down into pros vs cons .
three half pours of wine for like $ _num_ .
if i ever go back to this restaurant i want approx .
_num_ orders of this .
( this might be a pro to some ) boyfriend ordered their house cocktail .
he could n't drink it .
all in all , i promise you can find a better restaurant in charlotte .
did n't really care for the food here .
there are better restaurants to frequent .
blue could be great but it 's not .
there was only one sushi chef on duty .
owner was extremely polite .
waitress was not the best .
surely there are better places in town .
when they do deliver , it always takes longer than the estimated time .
it was bland !
there was no flavor at all .
having limited options in uptown i gave this place a few chances .
it 's just not good .
this is the worst sushi place in charlotte .
the website clearly stated the restaurant closed at 10pm .
all in all , it was def not my best groupon date night .
appetizers got there only _num_ minutes before main course , seriously ?
the kicker , the place was n't busy , not in the least bit .
i will never return here when i come back to charlotte .
strike _num_ .
strike _num_ .
worst chicken pad thai i 've ever had .
was sick to my stomach all afternoon .
of course , i 'm not sure it was really chicken .
the noodles were not good either .
bad move .
worst experience of my life .
i did n't like it .
earlier this week i decided to order a rather large order to be delivered .
the waiter never did refill my water glass .
felt rushed even though other tables were available .
my wife has made multiple phone calls only to have one returned .
horrible college .
i have never seen such a horrible community college in my life time .
i do n't think i 've had a positive experience yet .
you 're better off going in to speak to someone face to face .
do not waste your time here .
you 're better off taking your money elsewhere .
i gave one star because you ca n't give none !
do n't go for the jerk chicken .
i would try something else ... if i go back .
i was sooo very disappointed .
but i always prefer vegetarian and i 've had much much better food elsewhere .
as far as veggies goes , not tasty is for sure .
you get a lot of food but its kind of expensive for lunch .
plates that are old and worn .
it 's sad to see a small business that just does n't get it .
will not go back .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
very dirty and disgusting .
sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce .
got up and walked out .
i wish zero stars were an option .
i ate a few bites and tossed most of it in the trash .
there were no other diners in the restaurant .
we ordered the szechuan shrimp and scallops and also the shrimp in garlic sauce .
the place appears dirty , the service is not friendly .
did n't seem to care about having sit-down customers at all .
just a bad experience all around .
gross .
but i 'm not going to anymore .
they simply ca n't get the orders right .
tonight was the last straw .
never ordering from this place again .
this is a trash and security problem .
`` me never come back here '' .
the food here used to be good now it 's trash .
pay for extras that you do n't get when ordering in .
was really disappointed about that .
first of all , the customer service was great !
however , my jaw almost hit the floor when we received our bill .
our total bill was almost $ _num_ .
i did not feel that the dry cleaning was worth that much .
i would recommend others to check the price when you drop off your clothes .
worst auto bell in town .
it was n't even decent enough for one star .
however the content was way too old for my _num_ yr old .
_num_ minutes !
also , what kind of a market does n't have bread you can buy ?
literally , the entire store , no bread !
monday you did n't have meat .
what kind of deli runs out of meat and white bread ?
problem is , there wo n't be a next time .
i try to be fair ... but after _num_ strikes .
i would strongly advise anyone seeking a quality landscaping contractor to look elsewhere .
_num_ dollars ?
i called to say i was going to be ten minutes late .
smells gross all the time , small portions for a hella large price tag .
spend your money eating something w personality !
and the service last time i came was horrible !
the younger girl did them and did a bad job .
she made an excuse that the brush was too big .
she did n't ask me , she told me to come back tomorrow .
there is no tomorrow .
i will not go back !
he never responded to my call for repairs .
maybe my standards are too high .
i had a chicken biscuit , and the boyfriend had egg and bacon .
but the biscuits just do n't cut it for me to try them again .
disappointed .
the flavorless meat drowned in sauce is not acceptable for any real barbecue lover .
i felt like i was robbed .
but it just fails to deliver too often .
to be honest , that sealed the deal for me .
the food just does n't measure up to that kind of poor customer service .
once again , the nurse 's attitude was inexcusable .
long review , but i felt strongly enough that i wanted to post .
she cut me off every time i started to speak .
you do not know the specific circumstances surrounding my situation .
i was so glad it was over .
this place just made me feel so uncomfortable .
do not go here , it 's an utter disgrace .
no bed side manor .
horrible experience and expensive .
in my opinion they could not possibly be legit recommendations .
it 's generic , it 's dull , and it 's over rated .
if they had not i would have left .
the pizza , the calamari , the pasta .
my husband and i ate here this evening .
we were seated promptly without a reservation and the waiter quickly took our order .
the server brought some cold , salty garlic rolls .
my ravioli was barely cooked .
that , like i said , i give up .
i could not agree more that this is so funny .
just plain salty and awful .
they kept the beer and wine flowing at our table at every visit .
the crust was bland and the filling seemed sparse .
i was underwhelmed but my coworkers raved about their dishes .
the bread was already soggy like it had been sitting for a bit .
my friend had calamari that she did n't care for at all .
with grilled veggies and mashed potatoes .
leftovers are in my future .
still , i was n't blown away by it .
i was mildly annoyed because i do n't think she even acknowledged my presence .
i do n't see a return in my future .
goat cheese - this was without a doubt my favorite of anything all night .
it was good but nothing to rave about .
y'all clearly have never eaten outside of charlotte .
both times ive had the penne alla vodka , once again its pretty mediocre .
rude !
when i say frequent , i mean every friday .
like one reviewer below mentioned , this is just a step above olive garden .
i have been to italy and this food is nowhere near `` authentic . ''
i 'm not sure why this restaurant gets such a high rating .
i was rather disappointed in most aspects .
the pasta was also overcooked .
this place did n't have the authentic taste i was looking for .
the atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking .
totally not worth it .
we used to really like their lasagna and pizza .
even the rolls were almost stale .
guess i will stick to a salad , appetizers and bread pudding .
maybe i 'm weird .
but it seems like recently , everything at mama 's is over seasoned .
one time recently the server was really inattentive .
i took my mom out for her birthday and we left disappointed .
i do n't know why this chef would completely change the perfected dish .
mediocre italian food .
i had a pizza and it was quite bland .
the food here was just adequate .
the waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first .
we then said : it tastes like peanut butter and she replied : really ?
but does n't nutella tastes like peanut butter to you ?
the last few times out experience was just fair .
they did accommodate us after my request to put _num_ tables together .
it really was n't her fault that the food was awful !
it was pretty average italian food , nothing to write home about .
the bread they bring to the table before dinner was n't very good .
no taste .
i ordered the cheese ravioli and added two meatballs .
shrimp is either cooked or it 's not .
incredibly bad management and ownership .
i know where i am not welcome .
i guess i do n't really have a choice .
i got the penne ala vodka without prosciutto because i do n't eat meat .
i was very disappointed !
they were apologetic when they finally realized my meal was n't touched .
it was much better than the spicy pasta .
in buffalo , we like a little pasta with our sauce .
took money out of my account for late fees .
never notified me , never called nothing .
horrible customer service .
ca n't wait to go back !
worse customer service i have received in quite awhile .
sorry i bothered you from sitting on your *** .
suggestions , maybe do a little housekeeping .
too bad i ca n't give no stars .
will not return ever .
i used to frequent v cleaners & alterations .
_num_ dress shirt .
so from that day forward , i started to patronize them less .
i started referring other people here but i will stop the referrals immediately .
plus the quality is not great and never replace buttons when broken .
i will find a more customer oriented business that appreciates customers .
very condescending people .
we had film developed and the outcome was very poor .
charged for _num_ and only did _num_ .
dishonest , poor quality and bad attitude .
i do n't see how they could possibly have any repeat business .
i had an emergency on the morning i was leaving for europe .
i even questioned it because i said it did n't look right .
really bad service .
when i returned to grab the photos , they were horrible quality .
( this was a different , older man btw ) .
either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill .
recently i placed a take out order .
later , i went to the other bartender for another water .
hmmm , he charged me only $ _num_ .
i bought tickets online _num_ days prior to the show .
if it was made so clear ... why were we having this discussion ?
i was n't impressed at all .
too cramped .
could n't get to the bar .
no service once there .
i took a _num_ lb package to ups and asked for a quote .
first of all , the food came very quickly , which is rare .
the salad was just so-so .
i travel to clt fairly regular on business .
waitstaff was not helpful with the menu .
the food was mediocre at best .
if you really want great indian food ... go to copper .
it 's all about curries , rice , naan and spices .
would i eat here again if i 'm in the area ?
time to find a better indian place , i 'm afraid .
i 'd adventure elsewhere to indian if i were you .
i really want to love this restaurant but i really do n't .
sadly , both experiences were less than stellar .
bland does n't begin to describe the food .
absolutely no taste .
did my irish name cause my order to be overly americanized ?
even my little children were totally unimpressed .
terrible service !
will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go .
very bad service , rude staff , no customer delight .
we hardly could eat anything and left everything like that .
food was very bland and watery .
avoid !
the wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered .
the food was not to my liking at all .
very disappointed .
the food was okay but lacked the spices and taste .
the food was warm and nothing was heating it .
was very disappointed with level of quality and service .
ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals .
the vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily .
the employees spoke very little english and that was a huge barrier .
they also seemed arrogant and rude .
this was the worst indian i 've had in charlotte .
i now know why this place is always empty .
the spice was horrible .
all bland , boring curries and an always empty naan bin .
someone needs to wake up , update , and start cooking with passion .
life is too short .
none of the items were cooked properly .
very very disappointed .
wo n't be back .
the customer service however has been lacking each and every time .
so bad !
the standard is appalling .
he then proceeded to tell me that he only offer _num_ % .
if you ca n't do bother signing up for it .
it was poorly made and poor ingredients were used .
let alone very poor value for portion size .
the worst indian food i have ever had in my life .
there are not much options for buffet on sunday .
food taste was not that great for the money we are paying .
and coming to the taste it is horrible .
menu only have _num_ chicken dishes and both were just average .
disappointed with the quality of the food .
it did not taste authentic .
very disappointed .
it says a lot when your patrons are non indian .
told them it has no spice and they brought hot sauce .
finally this is a place to avoid if you are looking for good food .
i was quite disappointed .
the food ai n't bad .
i was a customer , and my car got towed .
i 'm really confused about the positive reviews of this place .
- just iceberg lettuce and cucumber !
none of these tasted good , tom yum soup was kinda disgusting .
it did n't taste like anything !
my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for a long time .
the sushi is very plain and not high quality either .
pretty awful entrees , sushi was n't bad and decent service .
i ordered the curry with rice noodles ; it was bland .
the flavor for the coconut curry was very bland .
terrible service , waiter was extremely rude .
do yourself a favor and do not eat here .
one of the worst restaurant experiences .
food was mediocre and the waiter should not be working in he service industry .
disgusting !
they had been our favorite for years .
every item of food was really unimpressive .
but it turned out to be a real bad experience .
even all other orders were very well below average .
my hibachi shrimp was very hard and tough as well .
the veggies were the only high spot .
the brown rice was mushy .
over _num_ % of the class failed the final .
do not waste your money .
they dont go over the math which is a big part of the test .
it does n't get any worse than this !
excuse me ?
it was clear all she cared about was bringing me to the cleaners .
i could go on for hours but it 's not worth it .
the food was to die for and the service was perfection .
however getting a quote and information from them was beyond frustrating !
i submitted a request online , a week went by and i heard nothing .
right off the bat she said `` no . ''
after a brief hold , she came back and said `` no . ''
i did n't find all of the staff to be overly professional .
nonetheless , filing taxes is a necessary evil .
this is the worst chinese restaurant that i have ever eaten at .
i went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed .
just basic chinese food .
sadly , not the best place to go for a friendly staff .
: ( i 'll buy online before i go in here again .
the chicken parm sub i ordered was a hot bland mess .
not here .
the roll was cold like it was just pulled out of a bag .
not steamed or toasted and not soft .
also a few hours after i ate i got sick to my stomach .
but i am never going back again , and this is why .
i got stuck in terrible traffic and arrived minutes before closing time .
`` i 'm sorry , we close at six . ''
`` oh no , it 's after six ?
as i walked away , i looked at my phone .
i was turned away , despite the obviously urgent situation .
no note or sign for explanation .
unfortunate because i would have enjoyed trying it !
run , do not walk away from this place .
unless you do n't mind paying a fortune .
do n't trust them with anything you want to keep .
first and last time i will be going to jones dry cleaning .
do yourself a favor and go to quail dry cleaners next door .
after taking one bite i 'm less than satisfied .
it 's cold and completely unimpressive .
there are far too many better pizza places to indulge in .
this is not a review about papa johns in general .
terrible !
go to domino 's if this is your papa johns for your area .
inefficient and lazy .
this place is awful do n't trust them .
honestly , this is the worst food i 've ever purchased .
flavorless , undercooked , and late .
had to sign up just to inform others not to waste their money .
papa johns should be ashamed of themselves .
the person could n't get the information right .
was told it would be _num_ minutes for a small pizza and wings .
no stars and no more business from us !
the french fries are ok , i guess .
i wo n't be going back .
very slow `` servers '' .
the bald manager is not a very nice person also .
the parking lot is small , barely wide enough to get your care into .
when i questioned the cashier she did n't apologize or anything .
tipping should be up to the customer , not the cashier !
at this point i ca n't even get a return call .
not sure if this was fixed or not .
we also got the standard egg rolls and crab rangoon .
i mean , c'mon , it 's veggie lo mein !
the cherry special chicken , however , was pretty darn tasty .
overly sweet and not so appetizing .
good chinese takeout here , seems to be hard to find .
nothing to rave about , but not terrible either .
i was very disappointed .
i will be getting my chinese food elsewhere .
the coupon was spend _num_ , get _num_ off .
in any case , i was a little let down .
i 've had worse .
my cookie had no fortune .
it 's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff ... nasty .
and the beef with broccoli was worse !
on second though i think my cafeteria was better .
it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza .
seriously , do n't go here .
con : they ca n't get the online orders right .
i even asked for low salt , low sugar , and low msg .
con : they reheated the same food they 'd made earlier for me .
rice and the veggies i got were no problem .
but i was also delivered some super soggy crab rangoon .
con : i really do n't think i 'll be ordering from them again .
nothing to write home about and pretty expensive .
i was very disappointed in the food .
they were essentially fried wontons , not crab rangoon .
i will not be ordering from here again .
this place has really fallen off .
food was _num_ mins late .
everything was not in my order on delivery .
mongolian beef was filled with all onions ( for filler ) .
nothing but excuses from this place when called to ask .
delivery has gone downhill .
food was lukewarm at best by the time it arrived .
i was very disappointed with food here .
canned soda no refills .
would not recommend .
the health code rating has also fallen from a _num_ to a _num_ .
after _num_ years of ordering here i wonder if it is under new management .
it has gone downhill .
it 's the only place i order my chinese takeout from .
mine did n't show up in my delivery order .
neither was spicy at all .
very bland .
what i do n't like is they often forget to give you rice .
it was theory tasteless love me in i 've ever eaten .
boiled pasta would have had more flavor .
this would n't really bother me much if the food was better .
crystal clear and the music sounded like a million bucks coming out of it .
, the beers are cheap and cold .
anyway , we had to purchase more tickets at the door .
guess the best advice , just pay at door .
oh and last thing that should n't be over looked , the shower .
so you ask why _num_ stars , simple it was location location .
they 're out of bacon , yes bacon !
the ham was cold and salty and the turkey was like bad deli meat .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
my husband and i stayed here as a weekend get away to charlotte .
we would n't have been able to sleep in even if we wanted to .
the worst part was the water in the shower never got hot .
there is nothing worse than a lukewarm shower .
but my praise begins and ends there .
not even open on saturday mornings ?
terrible ) .
_num_ years of loyalty mean nothing if you are laid off .
some of the worst chinese take out i 've had in a long time .
the chicken was overly breaded and very soggy .
it was very cheap - but i guess you get what you pay for .
and followed up with `` why would n't you pay for this ? ''
crab rangoon was terrible .
also ordered beef & mixed vegetable , meh .
my first & second experience here were both the same -- horrible .
i was horrified - however did not know where else to go .
horrible service .
the worst pizza hut ever .
stayed on hold for _num_ mins trying to change an order .
customer service is awful i wo n't be eating here ever again !
i received no apologies or explanation as to why it took so long .
do not go to this one .
this pizza hut is quite possibly the worst service i have ever received .
what type of pizza could possibly take over two hours ?
this type of service is just completely unacceptable .
wrong pizza was delivered .
very rude .
this location has the worst service .
my entree , the scallops served with risotto , was fine but overpriced .
for $ _num_ i received three scallops on a bed of risotto .
was n't memorable , exciting or impressive .
i can not believe this place exists !
seriously , the youngest person there was in their early _num_ 's .
avoid at all costs !
we tried it again tonight for our anniversary dinner .
big mistake .
the descriptions were nice but the food did n't live up to it .
not worth the money .
why ca n't employees act kind to those who are dining in their home ?
very cold .
annoying .
so cold .
the ravioli app was cold and tasteless .
unfortunately we found it to be a bit of a miss .
when we walked in the restaurant decor seems dated , or perhaps just generic .
we split the chopped salad with gorgonzola .
i dunno - just not that great and i wo n't go back .
while everything was decent , nothing really came together .
skip this one .
interesting old house feel to the place .
i had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick .
the hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty .
this is not authentic cajun food !
this has got to be the most overrated restaurant in charlotte .
i 've been _num_ times and i have never been impressed .
but this last time was horrible .
every dish we had was completely flavorless .
fortunately it was only half price because of the groupon that i used .
maybe it 's because people have never had real cajun cuisine before .
the fried green tomatoes were blah .
the batter was n't tasty at all .
my entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp , chicken and crawfish .
the seasoning was weak .
the portions were good .
neither one of my two friends finished their plates .
i will not be going back .
parking was hard to find and it was loud inside .
but not a good group night .
i do not understand the hype about this place .
everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre .
i did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable .
thank god i only went bc i had a groupon .
this was our first visit to this restaurant .
however this dish ( cajun platter ) lacked any type of cajun spices .
gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt would n't have hurt .
my fiance and i went to cajun queen one night as a date night .
i was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance .
the food was spicy not flavorful , just spicy .
needless , to say not a great experience .
i would n't return or recommend this place .
they lack favor in their food .
it was not good .
visiting charlotte from los angeles while husband is in town for business .
not the shrimp , the sauce with bread dipped in .
the bad : food is mediocre .
but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless .
the final insult : the grits .
so incredibly let down by this dining experience .
meanwhile , the food was terrible .
how does one mess up a cookie pie ?
do not waste your money !
it was n't awful , but it was n't anything special .
the seasoning certainly did not taste cajun to me .
( i got the crawfish creole and my girlfriend had the chicken etouffee . )
bottom line : i will not be going back .
very loud , bad service , and the food does n't met the expectations .
dirty plates were sitting in our table for a long time .
the owner could care less about customers .
nothing cajun about it .
they did not use our groupon correctly .
save your money and dine elsewhere .
i 'm not sure why this place is rated _num_ stars .
the food is barely ok .
the gumbo taste watered down and the service sucks to the 10th degree !
she came back _num_ min later .
do n't waste your time .
go to a better cajun restaurant , this one is not worth your money .
cajun queen was n't awful , but it was n't great either .
while not on par with new orleans , it 's not without charm .
still , not the big easy .
_num_ - new orleans .
very dissatisfied and disappointed .
will not go back .
went over year ago and was disappointed in the shrimp and grits .
this time , gave another shot and tried oysters and shrimp .
the side house salad we ordered for an additional $ _num_ was awful .
there were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber .
the waiter was loud and annoying and our drinks ran out several times .
the past three times have been very disappointing !
either way i will not go back .
the staff is unfriendly and rude .
so of course , i refused it .
trying cajun yard dog next .
if that 's a bust , so much for cajun in charlotte .
a friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at cajun queen .
watery gumbo started off our meals .
no one finished their meal .
only one person even bothered to take home their leftovers .
very bad service .
i will definitely not visit this place ever again .
maybe it was the awful dinner spot they put my husband and i at .
we were next to the kitchen and it was really loud .
my husband got the chicken shrimp diane .
when it came , it was mushy and had the consistency of baby food .
i 've never had pecan pie like this texture before .
this place is awful !
was with friends for a birthday and it was _num_ degrees outside that night .
the reservation was for _num_ and _num_ of us got there first .
at that point i was ready to leave .
the food was horrible and they included the tip without asking .
i was so mad .
i will never never never never never go back .
horrible customer service and horrible food .
i did n't eat it .
fried green tomatoes were good .
bbq shrimp were fine .
i 'll never return again .
reservations at 5:30 on a saturday and it was packed .
creole tasted like a can of crushed tomatoes .
it was just embarrassing to new orleans .
we ate there some time ago but they just threw three strikes for us .
i did n't even bother going on .
parking sucks .
downstairs tables are too close .
not a fan .
even the rolls sucked ; very dry and tasteless .
me and my spouse order the same thing every time .
i believe he is the manager and is n't the most friendly manger .
leadership in these places however are what make your business .
then change how you handle your customers .
i 'm constantly amazed by how rude the receptionists are .
i had high hopes for the quality but i was disappointed .
mac and cheese boring , bland , no flavor .
cake dry boring i dont believe it was home made .
i stopped by the chicken box to grab lunch today .
the real shame is that they obviously changed the fried chicken recipe .
does anyone know where the old managers went ?
this new chicken box cafe is terrible .
this is no longer the chicken box cafe .
old owners or new owners , it was n't very good .
the fried chicken was n't crispy or seasoned like before .
very disappointed .
it was empty when i arrived around _num_ pm .
_num_ minutes .
my mother , daughter and i went here last week .
waited _num_ minutes for rice and gravy and got a refund .
it was ready within seven minutes or so , not bad at all .
wow , how rude !
do n't go here you will get ripped off !
as i was walking in i noticed a sign stating estimates were $ _num_ .
apparently they do n't have a lot of confidence that their prices are competitive .
umm , are n't dealerships supposed to be the highest ?
i hate to admit this but this is not first accident .
oh and you have to put _num_ % upfront .
i 've never been treated like this .
do n't fall for it there 's too many options !
so , i went with a staple dish , vegetable lo mein .
too expensive .
was really rude when i followed up on one question .
their work is shoddy and inconsistent at best .
even after constant complaints , this company has continued to deliver sub-par service .
only if you are from chicago and you prepared it .
but it was a mixed rack ... .
mac & cheese : so , so .
two words ... ... keep driving !
i 'm dissatisfied !
they do n't keep fresh food out like they should for the drivers .
did n't trust the hygiene of it based on the rest of site .
this place is disgusting !
the bathrooms are horrible and the coffee stations are nasty .
if the bathrooms are bad i will never buy coffee or food .
worst pilot ever !
food came correctly and my iced coffee was bomb !
no , my sign was you just walking away , lol wow .
oh well , ca n't win them all i suppose .
the food is ok but the service is awful .
absolutely the worst service ( if you can call it that ) .
you just get in your car and drive .
we were like , whoa , where the heck did that come from .
that 's what ruined the racing experience . )
customer service was seriously lacking .
i just did n't feel welcomed .
i 'm barely decent on the track but geez .
hopefully i get a better experience next time .
this was possibly the worst experience i have ever had as a parent .
we went to have a snack and wait til the next round .
if i could give zero stars i would .
the `` move over '' sign is utterly ridiculous .
i have zero problem moving over in order to allow faster drivers to pass .
two of us were forced to go the next round .
on a positive note , saturday is half off on ladies night .
terrible customer service .
first of all , it is in a sketchy part of charlotte .
however , it was very deceiving because the customer service was not good .
little did i know , that race was starting in five minutes !
apparently , the adult races run every hour .
well , they could n't help me with that either .
i really did n't want come back here though .
if it was n't for the price , then i would not even bother .
furthermore , i would rather drive _num_ minutes more to concord to race there .
they should just say its a flat rate charge .
small station .
outdated for the volume of traffic handled .
we did n't move for an hour and a half .
`` could be _num_ .
i repeat , this is a station review !
that 's a problem for another review .
and it is ugly .
terrible train .
staff are totally rude .
no southern hospitality whatsoever .
if you take a train out of here , have someone drop you off .
besides the limited parking , i would not want to leave my car here .
not very professional .
so , two weeks roll around and we head out to noda .
she asks my husband to reschedule .
monday , no phone call all day .
for my third tattoo , i decided i wanted to go to fu 's .
spent almost $ _num_ on a custom tattoo i found online that i wanted .
would not go back and would not recommend to anyone .
i wo n't go here ever again because of the poor service .
none to be had here !
please do not waste your time , gas or money .
really , not an apology or let me get the manager .
crappy hair dryer .
holes burned in comforter .
stayed one night in _num_ bedroom unit .
he slept on the sofa both nights .
for me , who was paying the bill ... not ok .
for being a hilton i was n't too impressed !
cold burger .
rude people overall .
i do not understand why this place gets any business at all .
both the cashier and the owner would not give me their names .
horrible place .
that 's sad .
no stars .
do n't waste your time or money .
i wish i could give a minus _num_ .
wrong !
he was the rudest , most ignorant employee i encountered in the entire airport .
only if you 're lucky though .
i did not have a great experience in this airport .
it 's tough to be a vegetarian in nc , i guess .
anywhere remotely healthy or yummy looking had an insane line .
the layout of clt is terrible .
i ca n't stand this airport .
the us air passenger service agents are complete jerks .
one of my least favorite airports .
honestly wish i could give it zero stars based on today ... ?
security is beyond the worst .
check in with the airline was smooth , thats about it .
i could n't help myself .
this is the worst airport layout ever .
this service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand .
to me , these are the airport 's only redeeming qualities .
tsa security is the worst .
no help , no smiles , to slow , do n't care .
no preferred line .
generally a dirty airport ( delta terminal ) .
go to a bathroom that 's not serviced by these greedy people .
clt needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas .
there was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone .
she made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end .
she then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line .
and if it is , it is the worst nightclub airport in the world .
please do yourself a favor and avoid this airport .
charlotte ... could suck less but there are some things they are doing ok .
some of the walkways seem narrow but that could be just me .
hate security here .
i 'm not sure which is the worse nightmare .
must have been standing there for at least _num_ minutes .
this airport has ridiculously long lines .
for some reason , i found this airport to be kind of depressing .
i 've only been here once , so i would n't know .
there are many dining and drinking options , and cool rocking chairs .
very outdated , and super crowded .
this airport is just kinda weird .
when i got through , i had to go through security again .
your free wi-fi is totally useless .
internet is free but outdated .
slow and hard to get on .
it will only get worse .
the two stars are bonus points , but it gets the basics wrong .
that 's a deal breaker for me .
security checks are here to stay , do something about it .
- tsa agents are often rude and overly aggressive .
- not enough airlines service charlotte or compete for its business .
- not enough direct flights in or out .
long term parking lot was way over crowded .
plus , the shuttle bus was way over crowded and hot .
i ended up driving back to the hertz lot and dropping off my car .
the rental buses are relatively quick but the guy that was driving -- suck !
the us airways terminal was packed as usual , i expect no less .
little did she know i know what the hell i 'm doing .
i 've only been traveling all of my life .
i get through security and notice the tight space of this terminal .
why do they have no tram ?
at other airports , the gates are in close proximity .
except all of them were yelling over each other .
so help me god , i do n't care .
i do n't feel bad .
for some reason i always have to connect between terminal e and terminal a .
i hate hate hate hate hate this airport , because i hate us air .
i get delayed every single time ... occasionally i get cancelled .
this airport could be better , but even the free wifi ca n't help .
not a terrible experience but not an amazing one .
i like lax as my favorite airport .
i did n't check in so i have never waited in line at tsa .
it restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in carolina .
and the seats are certainly not designed for sleeping .
we officially hate charlotte .
everyone who works in this airport is miserable .
so it has made us assume that everyone in charlotte must be as well .
every place i 've eaten here is horrible .
as usual , the moving walkways are n't working either .
the food options are spread out , expensive , and impersonal .
this airport is not the best .
worst airport ever .
it is not near the top of my favorites .
horrible .
worst us airport ever !
no i do n't want to pay you money for doing your job .
my final piece of advice , wear comfortable shoes and stay alert .
the trash cans i saw in the seating area were also overflowing .
overall the experience was unpleasant , i 've been to much better airports .
hate you .
i had trouble finding a seat since most had trash or were dirty .
what the hell ?
she can walk , but not fast , and not far .
and she does n't do stairs at all !
this is the most outdated and dingy major city airport i 've ever seen .
clt is begging for a major renovation !
the location , however , is stellar .
um , this airport sucks , okay ?
avoid at all costs .
i flew through here two times last week .
my problem here is that i expect better .
then , when i sit down , everything is a sticky mess .
not a fan at all .
worst airport in the area .
never come to clt on monday morning .
security lines are ridiculous .
i 'm not sure what their function is except to collect tips .
they do n't put toilet paper in the stalls .
they do n't clean urine off the toilet seats .
if you do n't leave a tip , then they are rude .
i 'm currently still sitting at the airport nearly _num_ hours later .
at this point i 'm tired of hearing that .
ridiculous planning if you ask me !
i arrived at charlotte _num_ minutes before my plane was supposed to leave .
we ran to the gate and there was no one there and no plane .
luckily there was _num_ more flight that night .
the absolute worst baggage handling times .
considering it 's such a big hub , it 's not all that .
crowded with narrow walkways .
with the gates built so far apart and narrow walkways .
it takes me a full _num_ mins to move from gate to gate .
been close to missing my flights a lot of times .
this is not the airport for international connecting flights .
worst combination of southern efficiency and northern charm .
ridiculous !
blew my mind away , but than again i will never get people .
i am from chicago and the people there are nicer than they were here .
you lose three stars for these things .
poor food quality .
the guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency .
this airport is having a terrible time with the parking solution right now .
they need to get this fix quickly .
poor planning .
poor traffic flow .
poor crowd control .
this airport is _num_ years behind other airports of similar size and volume .
you could probably walk it by then , twice .
no one seems to know what 's going on ?
nope not any better this time around .
worst baggage claim area i 've ever experienced .
terrible service !
very rude !
there is n't .
called several airlines they were unable to find anything .
stupid is not a good enough word to describe that suggestion .
been in three airports on our trip to north carolina .
in the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding .
terrible airport for a layover .
not to mention half the moving walkways were not working .
lots of places to spend money !
maybe ringing up pre packaged food is not for you .
your bad attitude and horrible service is part of the reason .
_num_ 1/2 star rating ?
its obnoxious , but it fits your airport well i guess .
all your outlets ... lol .
i am not that ugly ... i think .
huge waste of a layover .
the bathrooms are super outdated and small .
if you 're comparing it to any other modern airport it is substandard .
but it 's also dead .
by _num_ , almost nothing in the d terminal is open .
and the one sit down restaurant that is open has no outlets .
i personally feel awkward with bathroom attendants present as well .
unprofessional , lazy and making a bad name for the south .
i am not a fan .
this airport is not family friendly .
this is so frustrating !
avoid this airport .
after that no real food in the entire e concourse .
over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone .
any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere .
that gets annoying .
painful getting in and out of here with the construction and insane traffic .
seating is far less plentiful than it should be .
`` some time are a little slower than others . ''
get your act together .
this is the worst airport i 've ever been to in my life .
no one assisted us or even apologized for the inconvenience .
i 've not spotted a tram if there is one here .
there were n't any toilet seat covers .
that was a first time that i 've noticed rocking chairs in an airport .
this is by far the worst airport ever .
just do n't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !
not enough sets and it 's like going back to the 80s .
flew through here going to paris .
it was a terrible experience .
full of rotten people .
not enough seats and it 's like going back to the 80s .
ugly nasty concourse e .
it 's out of date and feels like _num_ .
it 's pretty gross .
everything else is pretty bad .
that 's saying something considering i travel _num_ % of the year .
worst airport for food i have ever been in , especially on the morning .
tsa here is horrible .
not a fan of this airport .
i was shocked at the foul language coming from both of them .
this airport is kind of crappy and old in general .
i 'm glad i had to run through between flights .
however , arriving in clt is another story .
i hate this airport almost as much as i hate charlotte .
man , i hate this airport .
i ca n't believe this airport has three and a half stars .
i will pay more to not have to worry about that in other airports .
internet is very cheap and should be provided accordingly .
its not that expensive or difficult .
it is no longer .
i am considering switching airlines so i no longer have to connect through clt .
worst airport experience .
there 's no restaurant outside security except a starbucks .
oh wait this is charlotte nc , never mind .
worst airport i 've ever been through .
some of us would actually like to get home to our families .
ridiculous .
never connecting through charlotte again .
got to be one of the worst airport in the us .
total travel of what could be _num_ turned into almost _num_ hrs .
note to self to avoid this airport at all costs .
i 'm just now checking my luggage , and i have stuff missing .
i stopped at the local stores the whole time i 'm in nc .
ridiculous .
oh and the free wifi is horrible !
do n't be fooled .
very crowded , not a problem .
`` free wifi '' never works , not a big deal .
always so busy coming through here .
delayed flights all around and sharing seating with another gate is ridiculous .
had to watch my step or else i would 've stepped on someone .
only redeeming thing was bojangles .
the workers however suck balls .
it seems way too small for the volume of foot traffic moving through it .
_num_ tries , _num_ mins each time .
confusing terminal approach and rental car return area .
worst wifi of any airport !
there are no teams here .
it 's annoying .
there are no overhead signs warning you of this .
waste of time .
then i go to the bathroom and there are attendants looking for tips ?
horrible avoid the american terminal at all cost !
a small airport that needs some improvement .
the lines for security here are long .
there are n't many places to eat here .
not here .
wendy 's is one of the slim choices for food .
there are n't too many things to see or do here .
no interesting shops .
i 'm not a big fan of this airport .
customer service : disappointing .
it was torture .
restaurants : disappointing .
other than that , it 's just a bunch of chains .
i just do n't have good experiences here .
security here is always a negative experience .
very strange and inappropriate comments coming out of one worker in particular .
it 's not our fault you work for the tsa and are miserable .
unfortunate .
really unfortunate .
unacceptable .
overly crowded .
often see people sitting on the floor at some gates .
the airport environment feels very rushed and stressful .
it is _num_ pm and the line is past the american check in counters .
there are only two lines in the inspection area and no one is moving .
went to the regular line and was through in less than _num_ minutes .
this has been a terrible experience .
i 'm a young african american woman on my way back to chicago .
every restaurant closed at 10pm on a friday night .
only thing open is starbucks .
ca n't stay in terminal .
american airlines did n't tell people that .
shame on you north carolina for encouraging a hostile environment .
i do n't want my money to go towards hate .
i 'm sick and disgusted with you !
i do n't see this at any other airports .
on average , _num_ minutes .
and while you 're waiting , tsa agents stand around chatting .
not once , have i had a reasonable answer to the hold up .
_num_ hour layover turned into _num_ and then finally a cancelled flight .
but this was going on long before i arrived at 5pm .
and weather was not a problem at that point .
the flight was leaving in _num_ minutes at this point .
i wish she would help everyone that ever needs help while traveling .
they did n't care that the flights were all delayed by _num_ hours .
okay no big deal .
he said all these drivers in charlotte suck at driving .
the last time i was here i was rushing between flights .
none of that stalls have sanitary pads for the toilet seats either .
this is a very poorly maintained airport but yet , somehow a major hub .
also , the flight was delayed ... how long ?
nah , just sit there and wait .
clt is one of american airlines hub and it 's extremely crowded .
no thanks clt .
furthermore , no one has returned any of my messages ... .
worst airport for baggage .
extremely slow for american on c terminal .
thanks for wasting _num_ minutes of my travel time .
the worst tsa experience !
next time i will avoid flying through this airport !
the tsa at this airport is the worst !
they really need a customer service training .
avoid this airport !
get rid of the mens room bathroom attendants !
quite possibly the worst airport i 've ever had a layover at .
that is where our connecting flight 's gate was located .
she did n't make my experience at this airport the best .
watch out for the angry lady with american airline where you check your bags .
this is a terrible airport .
crowded , no customer service at any of the businesses .
just an awful airport that needs to get back into the 19th century .
i 'm used to airports in cali where every seat has a charger .
long term parking at clt is dreadful .
avoid connecting through charlotte at all costs .
and i 've been to quite a few of those .
it 's a museum , not a zoo after all .
is that really too much to ask ?
anyway , i stood in line behind one other person to order my breakfast .
he then proceeded to get my coffee and fill my order .
thankfully , the bk employee continued to give me my cup of coffee .
do you really need _num_ bk employees standing around doing nothing ?
they said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich .
i said no , please , no tomatoes .
i get the sandwich , there are two tomatoes on there .
way too pricey for the chain .
avoid this place in the airport .
_num_ minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable .
epic fail bk , clean up your act .
too much to expect at a fast food joint .
horrible restaurant .
i know its fast food - but this place is bad .
no one that works there cares about food , service , or cleanliness .
it 's a pig bucket of bk .
i asked her for honey mustard , she didnt even hear me .
and no thanks or nothing .
not going back to this place .
you might get better service at the chilis too in the same airport .
the worst people i have seen in the business .
she is like you said no meat .
and her response was gold .
she said that they consider all the patty to be meat .
side order of buffalo chicken strips .
not a good choice for running between flights .
the item should be called buffalo soup with chicken strips .
avoid the buffalo chicken , just get the plain .
it 's probably a better level of ordinary .
i ordered a platter with no sausage as i dont eat meat .
they made me wait a long time and gave me a platter with sausage .
the order was $ _num_ for hash browns .
please do not eat there .
this is called no mayo .
couldnt give them zero stars .
that displeased me more than the disappointing food .
coffee is not that bad and it is convenient if nothing else .
the only negative was the lack of trays .
by far the worst restaurant in the airport .
this one is terrible .
food is poorly made , employees are rude , and service is slow .
the fries were good and the burger was as i ordered .
people would probably tell me that i 'm expecting too much .
i can not even with that .
would give it _num_ stars if i could .
shit hole !
too bad _num_ stars is not an option here .
the staff and management are rude and only want money .
save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet !
this place is so ghetto and trashy .
disgrace to the gay community !
do n't waste your time music out of date .
the combination kills it for you .
i was not impressed with her at all !
i had the spaghetti with italian sausage .
the sausage was piled on top the meat sauce in ground pile .
poor , poor presentation .
i tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges .
obviously the oven was too hot .
i wo n't be back again .
unfortunately being a charlotte institution does not mean tasty food .
i 've had better , cheaper italian elsewhere in charlotte .
did n't really make anything i could n't make at home .
unfortunately , i was tremendously disappointed .
saying that this dinner was awful is an understatement .
terrible greasy smelly cheesy food .
and to top it off the woman at the register was very rude .
i grew up going to this place but will avoid it now .
the worst pizza i have had .
she just said , `` i 'm sorry you feel that way . ''
i had _num_ pieces of pepperoni on an entire large pizza .
it was around $ _num_ .
i called back and eventually he offered to refund my money .
terrible customer service from manager .
food was only ok , but good portions for the price .
our waitress was good , but the manager ruined any positive experience .
it was ridiculous .
the lasagna and spaghetti is very generic .
but sadly , they have lost the art of making great food .
the pizza was horrible !
not much more than a chunk of lettuce drenched in italian dressing .
chef ramsey , where are you when we need you ?
if you want good italian or greek food look elsewhere .
our food came out relatively quick , which was a plus for lunch service .
while my portion was sufficient , there was nothing spectacular about the lasagna .
this is your standard , old-school red sauce italian restaurant .
it 's neither good or bad , really .
not even cooked !
disgusting .
$ _num_ or so for $ _num_ worth of walmart ingredients .
no way you 're actually getting either of those meats in the dishes .
the owners should be ashamed .
there were _num_ slices of pepperoni on it .
the sauce is horrible and the service is n't much better .
i told my server that the pizza was n't good .
i could n't tell the difference .
went here with a coupon , otherwise would have definitely not been worth it .
greek salad was pretty good but nothing else really was .
service fast but not friendly .
would n't want to eat there again , especially at full price .
all i can say is yuk .
not the absolute best in charlotte ... but also not the absolute worst .
the salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce .
my one must get here is the cheesy garlic bread .
they even have original menus as part of the decor .
they still use an antique register at the front check out counter .
this is by no means a must go to spot .
but if you 're in the neighborhood , stop by for a meal .
this place looks like it was frozen in _num_ .
this is not italian .
we could n't finish our meal .
sanitation rating _num_ ?
this was n't it .
for the entree , i had the eggplant parmigiana .
i ate as much of the eggplant and meat as i could dig out .
i 'll give it another _num_ months and try again .
the `` meat '' in my dish was some greasy lips and assholes .
needless to say , this was a mistake .
you are killing me !
and i could not have given less of a shit !
too bad the food is so bad .
i had a small side salad to start which the waiter described as greek .
for the pizza , ugh .
just bad .
frozen dough with chopped vegetables on it , little or no sauce .
tasteless is really the only way to describe it .
it 's really a shame because the location is so great .
food was horrible .
my daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza .
the decor is tired and old but cozy .
the food was horrible !
there was no lemon or anything fresh .
i told the server that the meat was dry , overcooked and old tasting .
she assured me that it was cooked earlier today and reheated when ordered .
the bread was cold and tasteless .
i will not be back .
the food is horrible .
i went to dinner with _num_ friends and we had a variety of food .
no one ate their entire meal .
no one took any left overs home .
i order an ice tea , it was horrible !
you ca n't mess up iced tea .
the bread was store brought italian bread from the grocery store .
the salad is bag salad from a grocery store with dressing on it .
a true waste of money .
i kindly sent it back .
i was overcharged by about $ _num_ but i did n't catch it .
so with tip a very disappointing mean cost me $ _num_ .
me and my wife went here for dinner tonight and the food was horrible !
_num_ ) the pasta was disgusting .
it is overpriced and not worth it .
i would n't even feed this food to my dog .
wow .
bank of america at it again with less than exceptional customer service .
will not recommend .
was n't very good at all ... .
taste like noodles , salt , and water .
not made with love .
im so sorry the owner died .
everytime we attempt to come here they are closed .
dirty and bug problems as well .
worst service .
customers are rude too .
our server just walked out .
like , just walked out .
no one comes from the back .
then , turns around and walks off .
no explanation .
all we ordered was a pasta , breadsticks and desert .
terrible .
avoid this place at all costs .
too many decent pizza places in charlotte to settle for this place .
would give it no stars if it would let me !
ordered from them only because they were open and delivered after 10pm .
should have taken the other reviews to heart as i had a similar experience !
no pizza , no call .
cold , and not exactly what i had ordered !
do n't patronize this place ... you 've been warned !
i get there and the place is chaotic .
i could n't even hear myself think .
very disappointing !
i originally ordered over the phone the delivery time was _num_ mins .
pitiful !
service sucked !
do n't think i 'll be back to that pizza hut .
the last time i finally got pizza delivered it took over _num_ hours .
the only explanation is piss poor management .
when the pizza finally arrived , it was almost doughy it was so undercooked !
every employee that works at this pizza hut needs to be fired .
when the police got there they made them refund my money !
almost _num_ hours to get a pizza delivered .
they could n't find the driver .
they argued and argued and refused to take responsibility for this .
horrible horrible service on the phone .
terrible customer service .
i got a flounder dinner there recently , asked for some extra tartar sauce .
they wanted to charge me _num_ cents for it .
food there is ok , nothing special .
not a big fan of this place .
very slow service !
the worst refill i have gotten in my life .
this guy looks like he did n't know what he was doing .
i have seen better and i ca n't say that i 've seen worse .
i would n't recommend this one if you 're in a rush .
there is a tv but it was n't on when i was here .
he sent it back _num_ times because they kept making it wrong .
bread , cheese , meat - that 's it .
every single time i go its dirty , every time .
tables , benches , whatever it is , dirty .
the food is usually below average and the workers barely speak english .
instead and skip this place .
the worst mcdonald 's i have ever experienced .
i honestly wish i can give this place no stars .
i 'll avoid this mcdonald 's at night .
they seem to have some of the slowest service too .
they 're cheap in the fries .
unfortunately i found this mcdonald 's in need of a good cleaning .
no one smiled , and my coffee order was messed up .
but no one seemed happy or to be taking pride in their work .
so dirty i decided i could not eat here .
i 'll leave the odor to your imagination .
side note ... .
ppl w/ guns kill ppl .
no way would i ever go back .
i was looking to trade and was offered _num_ % of what i paid .
i then asked to see what they had in the price they offered me .
not much , even in the used section .
i just could n't buy anything there because it was all too bloody expensive !
use the internet or drive over to matthews and go to fire power .
a word of warning for customers here .
so they are charging you $ _num_ to make a phone call .
but wait , it gets worse .
the background check is only required for long guns .
the last person i 'll point out is , i think , larry .
just looking at , and holding to see if you like how it feels .
i really feel sorry for those who continue to buy from here .
i 've never been overly impressed with hyatt .
wish i could give less than _num_ star .
needless to say , i would not recommend them .
the photos they posted do not do this place justice .
avoid this place .
made a reservation thru priceline on the parking shuttle and got there around 1am .
was too tired to care at that point so we stayed .
but the room was smelly and dusty .
but i have expected my car to be broken into in the morning .
not that we would have used it , but the pool was closed .
she booked us here on the way to ohio .
there was a small fridge , flat screen but no desk .
beware , this place is crawling with bed bugs .
do not stay here .
_num_ march 1st this is the date i went .
i should have just stayed another hotel and paid out of pocket .
the hotel was dirty and noisy .
the room was gross and the shower was disgusting .
worst hotel i 've stayed at in years .
if i could , i would give them half a star .
so overall , not good .
for the whole experience though ... bad , bad , bad !
really , it was a fine place to stay for the ridiculously low rate .
definitely not staying there again .
but we drove a long way and needed a place to stay in charlotte .
we got into our room , gross and nasty .
i would not recommend staying !
if you did n't know where it was you 'd miss it .
dining area is sparse , basic tables and booths .
got the chicken parm sub as recommended by yelpers .
mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich .
still not sure i would order it again .
menu includes hot sandwiches , wraps , gyros , and salads .
very average , pita was a bit dry .
chicken was pretty good though .
fries were fried in old grease .
i ordered a western omelette that was just completely destroyed by imitation cheese .
they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .
this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
i really thought they were much better than this .
they offered a lifetime warranty , so no future issue would be a problem .
this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
they brought the wrong one again .
i guess i will now wait another _num_ weeks to get this problem solved .
i just want it right & this ordeal over !

this is why i chose them to begin with as stated about .
before i go on the owners and staff are all pretty awesome .
no complaints there .
bathrooms are by far the worst i 've ever seen for a public restroom .
there is no reason they ca n't be cleaned .
seriously folks , the bathrooms here are beyond nasty !
and points off for cutting out indoor smoking .
do n't get me wrong folks .
as a matter of fact it was all over the place .
they gave me a $ _num_ discount for bringing my own hair .
it was a waste of my money .
please do not go to this salon .
they will try and scam you for whatever they can .
just do n't go here especially if you have natural hair .
if you are looking for customer service , look elsewhere .
this place is a mess .
i immediately cancelled my appointment and called around .
what you are getting for that value is not the same .
the bed was comfortable and the room was mostly quiet .
one night , there was vacuuming upstairs at 1am .
tip : avoid the ground floor if you are concerned about security .
i do n't see why not but there are better .
ive stayed here about _num_ times over the past 4-5 years .
the entire place is dirty and tired .
the elevator was broken ( and had been for a month ) .
overall - do not ever stay here if you can avoid it .
the room looked , smelled , and flat out felt terrible to be in .
it was a smoking room - and i do n't smoke .
you 've been warned .
i wish i could give them zero stars .
this place is disgusting .
the room brought more cat urine scent .
two bugs greeted me as i entered my room .
no bugs yet .
i will not be using the shower in the morning .
however , the rooms were worn and in serious need of updating .
the carpets and sheets were dirty and heavily stained .
this was by far the worst hotel i 've ever stayed in .
we stayed here one night .
it was disgusting and filthy .
elevator was broken so we had a brief encounter with him at 6:00 am .
what i learned ... do n't trust the stars , read the reviews .
this is the worst place i 've ever stayed in my life .
there was no soup or anything kind of body was .
the staff was rude and poorly trained .
my picture sums up staying at this particular micro inn .
the stench of smoke is horrendous .
this is the linens i am gon na go with . ''
the worst i 've been at was a howard johnson 's n nj .
we could n't wait to leave .
found a _num_ star one _num_ minutes away for just about the same price .
i feel bad for those that fell for this .
horrible stay .
smelled like urine .
totally gross .
the toilet then for the next hour continued to run .
the outlets along the bed wall do n't work at all .
it just looks trashy .
not entirely sure what that 's about .
old couch with fake leather peeling off of it !
although it says it 's non-smoking , my room reeked of cigarette smoke !
do n't be fooled by the outside because the outside is n't too bad .
missed my flight and this was the cheapest option .
poor location and service .
that was my only option because of the missing flight .
they only good thing is the crowded airport van !
my husband left the car again to have the repair corrected .
terrible !
i 'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place .
needless to say , that price is ridiculous !
you will not be disappointed like you will here .
needless to say , i 'm never going back .
while waiting on the manager , the angry cashier would n't shut her mouth .
the chicken is n't as crispy and juicy as i remembered .
it 's chewy biscuit drenched in honey butter and served at room temperature .
not only has the quality dropped , the service is horrible .
somebody just does n't give a **** !
as for quality , my chicken was piping hot just out of the fryer .
obviously that did n't do anything so the problem continued .
this was all during my favorite song which really made me mad .
food was mediocre at best , place seems kind of dirty .
would n't recommend .
our group mostly ordered the prime rib and two had the blackened chicken pasta .
it was served with canned pineapple and was overwhelmingly sweet .
why not serve chocolate cake , cookies , mousse ?
the show was bad .
i would not pay full price , and i would not return .
from the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home .
chicken was grilled at some point ( grill marks ) and was very dry .
white rice was rice was fine .
i 'm sure i will be back as my coworkers visit this place frequently .
sadly , my dish was as flavorless as possible and rather oily .
not even good for an eight dollar lunch special .
went there _num_ weeks ago and it was horrible .
not sure what happened to this restaurant but it has seriously gone down hill .
so something weird to begin our visit ... .
i have never experienced that in any restaurant before .
needless to say this was not my favorite !
no wonder disney world is making a killing in this side of the woods !
first time , last time .
the chicken was chewy and dry .
the french fries were barely warm either .
the biscuit was even small and dense .
not at all like other bojangles i have visited .
this location made bland , flavorless chicken .
the crust was rubbery and stale even though the chicken was very hot .
they were not even that busy .
the service was n't good at all .
the manager was rude and not very accommodating .
my order has been consistently wrong here .
the service is rather poor .
this is the worst wendy 's i 've been too !
seems management does n't care either ... .
restrooms are always dirty at every visit i 've been there .
ok , normally i would not review a fast food restaurant .
i wish i was surprised but it was ice cold .
the bun was firm like it was quite old .
the cheese was hardly melted .
probably the slowest drive-thru i 've ever experienced .
the sandwich looks like someone sat on it .
i did n't get a damn tomato .
i was wrong .
how in the hell is the line always long when the food is trash ?
although i 'm not a burger person , theirs was pretty tasty .
con : they only accept cash .
what really turned me off about the place was the car hop .
the bill was $ _num_ .
i gave the car hop $ _num_ and told him to keep the change .
i gave him a _num_ % tip .
what did he want _num_ % ?
i 'll spend my hard earned money where the food and service are better .
my visit was on a saturday between noon and _num_ pm .
the place seemed pretty busy with about _num_ % of the stalls occupied .
odd , but probably the most efficient .
the slaw was also minced rather than being shredded .
the pork was moist and tender , but very bland .
there was no smoke flavor at all .
the slaw was crunchy and fresh , but it too was bland .
but the pork although being tender and moist was disappointing .
overall it was n't a bad meal , but it was n't good either .
showed up to the ghetto as expected , but the meal was underwhelming .
did it , wo n't do it again .
all hype .
he does not know everything .
nothing special about anything , imo .
not the worlds greatest bbq chicken ( sorry guy ) .
second price got soggy and the crust is only good when crisp .
bbq sauce was n't good at all .
dude - here 's a tip - do n't ask for a tip .
well , would i go back the next time i 'm in town .
the sauce was too vinegary for my taste .
everyone else in my party said the same thing .
here 's a tip , do n't ask for a tip .
haha , i was being totally sarcastic .
oh my word it was horrible !
not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have .
baked beans were from the can .
this place was not so good .
the bbq chicken was just ok .
this place was old and i will definitely not be going back .
complete failure the moment we arrived .
meat was too salty and the hush puppies were just ok , nothing good .
def wo n't be going back .
i do n't know maybe it was a bad night i went on .
not like super cheap but the menu has variety .
the food was homestyle , bland , and majority of plates are fried .
the bun was soggy and gooey .
my boyfriend seemed to like the chicken so i tried a small piece .
the fried outer portion was soft and soggy with their special sauce .
it came highly recommended so maybe i just had a fluke experience .
, but i let him come and do at least the outside work .
after another _num_ minutes on hold , i hung up .
so frustrated with at & t 's horrible service !
something as simple as this still has not happened .
first of all , if i could i would n't give them any stars !
like i 'm supposed to be comfortable with that .
she finds anything to charge you to get extra money out of you .
prepare for the worst when you move over there .
the wings came out wings , but lacked any sort of taste in it .
i guess it was cheap .
it came with _num_ rolls , but they only gave us _num_ .
however , this place does have burgers and other menu items .
no thanks .
rounded down to the next star for this _num_ star review .
the sitting area was a nice size and the kitchenette area was clean .
no problem right ?
i do n't have a nicer room that i can move you to .
not returning anytime soon .
stayed october _num_
absolutely worst customer service for a hotel ever !
we accepted the room , thanked her and went to our room .
worst hotel experience i 've ever had !
poor management and extremely poor customer service !
the hotel staff itself was n't very welcoming .
the housekeeping was n't any better .
it included a dish washer and a microwave , small fridge .
although the it includes a dish washer it does not include any dishes .
no spa area .
fitness room only includes cardio .
breakfast was n't anything to look forward to .
it is very isolated with not much within walking distance .
the location and staff gives off bad vibes .
will was our driver .
apparently everyone gets in the wrong shuttle all the time .
probably because he knew he was n't getting a tip .
it 's not an excuse to not do your job , period .
north carolina , this is n't looking good for you thus far .
very poor customer service in the contact lens department .
rude front desk staff .
will not go back .
this place was awful to me .
terrible .
i never asked for it and do n't know why it was done .
coming up on an hour wait , ugh !
billing sucks .
my appointment was at _num_ .
it 's now _num_ and i 'm still waiting .
i would not return based on the lack or respect for my time .
they scheduled me an appointment with a specialist two weeks out .
i 'm taking my business elsewhere .
concord nc location : do n't go there !
they have the worst customer service i have ever received in life .
i took my prescription to another vendor and had my glasses made .
i could not see anything .
waited for _num_ mins past appointment time .
no respect for patients time .
the guy does n't know what he is doing .
not `` how can we make it better for you ? ''
that , or she did n't care .
i 'm not sure which is worse .
i wo n't be back .
slow unfriendly service .
desert area of buffet was never stocked and was dirty .
this is the worst company for customer service we have ever encountered .
corporate has n't even tried to make things right .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
but recently getting really disgusting .
tables and chairs are always nasty .
nasty !
this is a five star mcdonalds so to speak .
her fries are cold as are the nuggets .
the sprite is all soda no syrup .
the food was horrible both times i ate there in the past two weeks !
rude rude rude .
the workers are just plain rude .
the fries were nasty and the bun on my burger was stale .
mcdonald 's is mcdonald 's there 's nothing really special to say .
quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service .
i even contacted the manager once to complain about my repeated horrible experience .
i never received anything and also never ate at this location again .
i ca n't stand bad customer service .
they are hire incompetent morons .
they are hire incompetent morons .
so , i decided to go with _num_ hotcakes .
extremely disappointed with this company .
i found a property online that i fell in love with .
i was not only disappointed , but frustrated and angry .
this is not the way to treat potential customers and just people in general .
rude and unprofessional !
not pleased at all with their professionalism .
for the inside dining experience , mcdonald 's beats burger king , hands down .
new , clean but horrible service .
waited _num_ minutes for two breakfast sandwiches .
however , the food is definitely meh .
fries were a little soggy .
breakfast gets a _num_ , dinner gets a _num_ .
this is n't the first time either .
horrible !
dry chicken , bland help , yay it 's southpark .
so she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on .
it was bland , nothing special at all .
but i suspect the rest of the food are blah too .
the same owner 's mimosa grill in uptown charlotte is much better .
really not much to say .
also $ _num_ beers of which i 've had about _num_ .
i will not be going back any time soon .
unfortunately , i found little to eat for lunch yesterday .
what a disappointment .
i have only been 2x 's within a year and was a little disappointed .
i just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon .
it was ok but nothing special for $ _num_ .
probably would not go again .
sorry , the food was just horrible .
but with each experience , i am less impressed .
however , there are better places to dine within the southpark area .
the food is moderately priced , but is too much for what you get .
my last gripe with the restaurant is the limited menu .
this use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent .
flash forward to now , the tasty grilled portobello sandwich is gone .
what was left was less than 1/2 pound .
this place is as bland as they get .
the food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too .
i was so sad .
so in short the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down .
will not be going back .
our waitress was absolutely horrible .
to put it short , they should have just sent her home .
as for the food , it was bland , not much flavor .
this particular location is pretty hit or miss .
just is n't the same , maybe they sold ?
_num_ stars only because the service was good .
food sucked .
apparently a tuesday night is busy for the manager ( not the hostess ) .
tough and chewy , and the dull knife was not helping out .
the loaded baked potato was delicious .
i would n't bother to order it again .
and their garlic dressing is disgusting .
i do n't know why i continue to come here .
i dine here frequently and tonight was a real disappointment !
quality has went down as the price went up .
not worth going so much anymore .
that 's highly disgusting .
would never return if it was n't close and had to bring clients there .
i was very unimpressed .
soggy chips with a good steak .
i ordered the flat iron steak , which came smothered in a spicy sauce .
looks like we will stick with flying biscuit !
ca n't go wrong there .
if you like horseradish go for it , if not stay away .
i then chose the cheese and peppers omelette , with egg whites .
lindsay informed me they do n't offer egg whites , really ?
after ten minutes my waitress returned and informed me they could do egg whites .
so , i chose the omelette .
so , tonight we ordered two linguini and meatballs to go .
barely ate any of either serving .
we will probably be back , but only after the menu offers better fare .
pretty poor experience here .
not impressed .
nothing special and fairly expensive for what it was .
very forgettable .
the waiter was very young and a bit clueless .
the food was good but the shrimp and grits are not good .
that was _num_ mins ago !
is this your corporate policy or just an issue with your provider ?
avoid at all costs if possible .
the worst part is that this is the corporate store for the area .
she was very helpful and knowledgeable .
please avoid this place .
closes before _num_ pm and locked the doors as i walked up .
is it me or does the customer service suck ?
this place seems like the opposite .
the chicken salad is made with turkey .
there was 1/4 lb .
i do not want to eat a cheesesteak with a fork and knife .
i do n't like a sandwich with more mayo than meat , either .
i will not return to this place .
but i figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing .
so , i ordered the chicken cheesesteak , fries and some coleslaw .
this is not authentic if that is what you are looking for .
the cheesesteak was soggy .
not as crispy as others stated and they needed salt !
i did n't eat them all because they got cold and kind of gross .
how long should it take to make a grilled cheese ?
the paper tickets are so _num_ 's .
this is my 2nd visit and i am highly disappointed .
what i received was just turkey .
they are officially on the back end of my list of best delis .
the other 1/2 barely had more .
worst lunch experience of my life .
a little crowded but took an hour and came out wrong .
owners must suck every dime out of the business .
no empathy whatsoever about the situation .
staff is completely incompetent .
receptionist proceeded to tell me `` someone will call you when its ready . ''
( lie # _num_ ) .
( lie # _num_ ) .
no thanks .
folks , stay away from this place .
the patient is not seen as an equal partner .
after the 7th time being pushed away , i am taking my business elsewhere .
very hurt and upset with this business .
they could n't find any problem .
extremely poor service .
i 've filled tires 2x since so i asked them to check on tires .
no response to my concerns .
that , to me , says a lot about their skill level .
the apartments were great _num_ years ago , now not so much .
it 's been like this for the last _num_ months .
_num_ months later they still have not repaired my oven .
the leasing office is racist .
i would never recommend living here .
rude staff , shitty attitudes and unprofessional .
horrible .
it is christmas and i still do n't have it .
thanksgiving and christmas ruined by these jerks because i have no seating .
no help at all .
after two weeks i emailed again ( _num_ times ) and was ignored .
do not buy anything from this company if you live out of state .
it 's very dated and in need of remodeling .
there is only one small public restroom and no organization to the layout .
there is no security cameras in the parking lot .
then a few staffing changes , and things started going downhill .
things went from okay to a little worse to absolutely horrible .
yeah this place is horrible .
waste and pet waste all over .
the pool is never clean .
the hot tub does n't work .
it really just is a crap place to live .
lived there for almost _num_ years , at the very back if it matters .
my car was almost stolen once even with an alarm on it ?
if you ever have a problem you are seriously sol .
especially for a single lady i would seriously avoid .
one last thing , their maintenance guys are f ; in creepy !
i hated the fact these guys actually had a key to my apt .
and i 'd come home randomly and find them there for no apparent reason .
food tasted ok and was brought out really quick , hence the _num_ stars .
if my simple needs can not be met , then i become very disappointed .
this is where yelping has become my source of self help .
our mild salsa never arrived .
this was the first sign that it was going to be an interesting night .
no mild salsa , no rice ... ... why bother !
sure i will be back , but with lower expectations .
gross as it was , i understand that mistakes happen .
i was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews .
the chicken and beef had no seasoning that i could taste at all .
the refried beans was like sauce .
three of our five meals , the beef was n't cook completely .
the food did n't taste right .
needless to say , i am very disappointed .
nothing authentic about this place , will definitely not be going back !
i was overall unhappy with the service and the food at this establishment .
service was extremely grumpy .
absolutely no excuse for that !
there are far better mexican restaurants in charlotte .
frankly i do n't know how this one stays in business .
the food it 's self is nothing special or exceptional .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
what an awful experience i had with this salon .
she did not have a solution for the problem at hand .
needless to say some people do n't think outside the box .
is this a one person salon that can not resolve an problem like this ?
no response but she does call me _num_ mins later .
i told her i need a friday after _num_ any week .
she offers this friday at _num_ or 2pm .
that makes no sense .
she is a liar and unorganized .
horrible service !
i will tell everyone how horrible she is and how she is a liar !
get your story straight if you are gon na lie .
i have this place one star , because it ca n't get any lower .
very rude and unprofessional , let alone unnecessary .
what a waste of time .
unfortunately , it failed in less than one year .
it smelled and tasted awful .
to get home so that i could write it down .
i simply do not get a good feeling about practice !
looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot .
the park road office has terrible management and are very unprofessional .
i have never been treated so badly by a physicians office .
run , do n't walk , away from carmel family physicians !
their patient referral service is n't any better .
do n't go here - you will regret it .
horrible front desk service !
no letter , nothing !
do n't waste your time at this office .
this situation takes the icing of the cake though .
i can not get over how unprofessional and rude this office staff is !
please pay attention to the negative reviews before you experience carmel family physicians .
maybe it 's just chinese places that stop serving ?
they lost my business for good .
i know i should have called beforehand .
i felt like this one waitress was very rude .
it was kind of shady business practice so i wo n't go back .
service : confused but trying to be helpful .
the chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here .
not anymore .
i read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of _num_ .
customer service is lacking .
the waitresses said little to nothing ( which is the usual case ) .
really this place just needs to be more hospitable .
atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy .
i am a sushi snob , and am extremely particular about my sushi .
it tasted like wasabi , but why the hell was it brown ?
we also ordered pan fried pork with kimchi .
the rolls come in pieces of _num_ , which i find weird .
i am typically used to larger rolls with _num_ or _num_ pieces .
we have not been back .
venue - the ambiance inside the restaurant is like being in japan .
sushi - the unagi ( eel ) was cooked perfectly .
they need better selections in sushi .
as for sushi , i would only come here once .
also , if you do n't tip enough .
arrived , party of _num_ on a wednesday night .
terrible service .
the sushi set i ordered was a typical americanized sushi affair .
not authentic at all .
i was very unimpressed .
neither were anything special .
the chicken teriyaki was nothing more than some boiled chicken smothered in teriyaki sauce .
was not good at all .
the sushi was mediocre at best .
never know sashimi can be this bad .
worst sashimi experience ever .
the table was also sticky and gross !
i was not impressed and will never go back !
none were busy .
none would make eye contact or acknowledge my presence .
i 'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store .
looks like very other cvs .
unfortunately i usually come here for the pharmacy .
they are so slow and are not any help .
the wait time to check out is absurd .
usually only one cashier is working and they are slow .
painfully slow .
in addition to being slow , the cashiers i have encountered are rude .
i sent in a photo order online ( same day prints ) .
it took this cvs at least _num_ days to process the order .
oh no , same lady still at the register .
i understand that everyone has bad days .
that does n't excuse poor service and a `` screw you '' attitude .
i drove around for _num_ minutes looking for this place .
am i missing something ?
and the gym was okay but nothing special .
do n't move here this place is horrible !
there is something always wrong with the apartment .
the worst apartment i 've ever lived in !
i 've only been here _num_ months and i 'm miserable .
if you are thinking of renting here do n't !
they have `` lost my security deposit '' !
lease has me listed in wrong apt .
the biggest thing is they lost the money !
run , do n't walk from this place !
biggest mistake i ever made !
yep , mandatory .
never have i heard of this being done elsewhere .
but why did they sign up for this contract in the first place ?
worst management ever .
of course nothing happened on monday .
no one seems to be communication for efficiency .
i 've lived in many apartments before and this one is the worst .
here is another review on alexander place- the management team is horrible !
all they want is your money !
$ _num_ snacks .
$ _num_ coffee .
medium cup of tomato soup : $ _num_ do n't expect a roll .
no , thank you .
the sandwich options were limited , and staff completely unhelpful .
have given this new spot several chances and it has disappointed each time .
service is spotty and knowledge of wine / training of servers has dropped significantly .
but , we wanted to try the tuscan beans so stayed .
needless to say i will never set foot in this place again .
i repeat this was a bottle listed on the menu not from the retail .
d & d is expensive .
however , the food quality simply does n't warrant the cost .
a piece of two layer cake , is over six dollars .
my husband and i come to the wine room often because we live nearby .
it turns out , she 's not even old enough to drink !
the young man behind the bar did n't look of age , either .
i ca n't believe it .
it pains me to write this review !
however , there is no excuse for such poor service .
bar was empty sans a handful of people .
almost appeared to be an inconvenience for her to wait on us .
i 'll be back to d & d but not to the wine room !
worst service ever .
sat outside for _num_ min with no service .
waitress showed up _num_ min later .
will not come back until they change entire staff , other than bartender .
what a horrible experience .
just opened them up an poured .
neither of what we wanted when i said sweet .
we were not going to buy anything else .
he also offered me a free lunch on the house which i turned down .
bill came to $ _num_ .
wine prices even higher than paris or london .
they only cost _num_ in paris and _num_ in the rest of the country .
anyway , if i lived here i doubt i 'd hang here much .
had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine .
she suggested we grab some wine and take it back into the market .
i had the shrimp and grits and it was ... not good .
the spaghetti and mussels were pretty good though .
i grew up going to the south park location .
hence why i needed the coffee .
it was obvious we were n't up to par with the wine room .
there were only three other tables in the restaurant .
no excuse for this .
so this should n't be happening .
i never told them about the cockroach because they did n't deserve to know .
overall myself and my friend were deeply disappointed in our visit .
dumb .
stupid .
they did n't even deserve a one star .
this company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing .
the _num_ bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking dump when we moved in .
we gave a written notice to the leasing manager and a doctors letter .
no way will they get away with this .
bad decision .
i 'm terrified of those things .
she said oh , i do n't want to kill it .
terrible experience !
horrible place to live !
i can hear every ... single ... conversation that goes on in the hallway .
disturbing .
nothing had improved .
i now have roaches and my apartment has already been sprayed once .
i 'm beyond disgusted .
that is n't enough to make us love the place though .
dead roach on the bamboo on my steam dumpling basket .
perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup .
it was very bland , and did n't taste like anything .
tasteless egg in water is definitely not something you want to keep eating .
gross , what happened ?
this last time there was pure disappointment .
each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base .
it was way too salty !
blah ... and i 'm sad that it was n't better .
i find the rice in any chinese buffet way much better !
when we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section .
my daughter who picked it up had to leave .
i ended up eating crackers and peanut butter at home instead .
just awful !
my salmon was dry and flavorless with the filler rice .
i do not think i will go there again without a gift certificate .
too bad , i hope they change cooks .
this is a waste of time and money .
consider yourself warned .
but the food was not outstanding for the price or the ambiance .
it had no spice or bite at all .
the pepper steak was edible , but not delicious or memorable by any means .
it felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave .
i found out that portion size is good , then bad .
do not go there , they have no customer service !
years ago , this place was my favorite restaurant .
the service is incredibly slow .
apps were cold .
waiter was loud and too casual .
sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce .
this place could have gotten a better score but for the service .
they sent _num_ to a table of two .
not well designed .
wo n't be back .
it 's on the pricey side , but you probably know that already .
it takes money to keep the engine running .
what is really bad is the service .
well , that 's not entirely true .
but the wait for the food is absolutely ridiculous .
another bad experience two times in a row .
chang 's on tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible .
maybe i am spoiled but in every p.f .
here , however , i have received nothing .
i will not visit this restaurant anymore and can not recommend it .
at 1pm , with lots of open tables , they could n't seat me .
looks like they are having staffing problems .
so , today , zero stars , but overall two .
the service was not so great .
the waiter added another dollar to the tip i had already written .
he did n't deserve more than _num_ % .
we sat there for about _num_ minutes with soup spilled all over the table .
the menu changes are n't necessarily better .
my changs spare ribs were just northern style ribs with bbq sauce on them .
so salty i ate one and threw them out .
for almost $ _num_ we had a very disappointing dinner .
poor customer service .
tonight i wanted to grab a quick brew before a yelp event .
not so much .
no big deal .
too late dude .
worst mother 's day experience ever .
so it 's mother 's day and we did not have a reservation .
the wait time quote was an hour _num_ minutes .
they sat us in an hour _num_ minutes - not bad !
i expected to wait _num_ hours so technically they were early !
they had no high chairs so we had to wait .
_num_ minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal !
our meal did n't arrive to our table until _num_ 1/2 hours after ordering .
i kept bringing the _num_ month old outside to walk around .
the _num_ month old is not happy .
from now on , i 'll stick to take-out .
the whole staff especially our server were so unhappy saturday .
the food was so greasy and took _num_ min to come out .
she did n't seem to care at all either .
$ _num_ average a person for chinese does n't get you anything here now .
never again .
this was my second time here , and it was a disaster , again .
never have i had so much anxiety having a meal .
tried again today with my husband , nope .
the salad was nasty , iceberg with some dressing that tasted like onions .
i mean _num_ bucks is no big deal , but it 's extremely annoying .
very disappointing experience recently .
very poor experience no one accepts responsibility .
worst experience .
when did this place get expensive ?
small portions and pricey lunch .
had _num_ children with me and our lunch was $ _num_ .
not nice ... .
not nice ... .
yuck !
my wife and i went to pf changs tonight for dinner .
oh my gosh both of our dishes were horrible .
my wife got the honey glazed chicken and i got the sichuan beef .
the only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap .
even the stupid fortune cookies were stale .
caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale chinese food .
raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as i continue eating cake .
so disgusted !
called pf changs where the first `` manager '' sent me to another manager .
i love chocolate and that cake was $ _num_ ( tax ) .
taken _num_ tries to get order right and the server could care less .
i could not put another bite in my mouth .
it made me sick .
i have shopped at harris teeter park road for over _num_ years .
i have witnessed same manager return a cake only _num_ slices left .
returned with smiles and no hassle .
it is _num_ park rd harris teeter .
tried to buy about _num_ worth of groceries at self checkout .
refused to substitute as i see other customers do all the time !
_num_ employees confirmed no more waters in back .
still no fair and normal customer service offered to me ?
i do n't understand the hype for this place .
service was ok and my filet mignon was so overcooked and lacked flavor .
will not come back .
eh , went here on christmas for dinner .
wine was outrageously overpriced .
overcooked , tough and tasted like it had gone bad .
been there _num_ times .
not a big fan .
i was very , very disappointed in this place .
we ordered the burgers and they were dry & barely edible .
our waitress was also terrible .
slow and inattentive .
do n't waste your money .
this was n't my first choice , but sullivan 's was not available .
the choices were pumpkin or chocolate pecan pie .
i am disappointed that a high-end steakhouse does not have a pastry chef .
it is impossible get from a to b outside or inside the place .
we asked ... should we get out own menus ?
he then proceeded to chat with some waiter buddies in plain view .
i just could n't believe a _num_ oz .
so , we ordered the veal and chicken parm .
up to ~ $ _num_ ) .
honestly i 'm not sure what the big rave is about this place .
and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak .
desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake .
thankfully it was n't my tab and i 'd never go back .
_num_ different family events and all _num_ were screwed up .
it was so burnt as to be charred .
it was turned into gray meat and cost almost _num_ dollars .
way overpriced and not worth the trip !
noisy , noisy bar !
if you want a great steakhouse , go to ruth 's chris .
it 's a shame but both of the things i had heard were correct .
it just was n't that good .
the steaks had no flavor and the lobster was overcooked .
the filet was also not very flavorful but better than the lobster .
i will not be back !
we ordered the humongous $ _num_ lobster and we should have known better .
lastly , we made our reservations through open table , which was honored .
just ca n't see it for the money .
not quite sure what the target market is for this place .
capital grille two weeks ago , my son , same thing .
not impressed with the food .
in fact , it is barely even memorable .
ok food , not too exceptional .
not to return , i am afraid .
velvet corn and chicken soup was tasty but needed lots of pepper .
ugh ... way overpriced , same taste as the food court at the mall .
no crab .
it would have been nice if they had told me this before i ordered .
the dumplings were just okay .
waited a long time to try this place .
however , the food was borderline bad .
the chicken portion was at least half vegetables , which was very disappointing .
the chicken itself was mediocre at best .
staff is rude .
the replacement order was poorly made and rushed .
i was highly disappointed .
the least she could have done was to put a credit on my account .
i immediately notified the staff and was told the manager would be notified .
this is the worst experience ever .
it is jessica fault !
give me a break !
this is the last time i visit this establishment .
the eggs i ordered scrambled and they were too dry for me .
unfortunately , a charlotte main stay has worn out the welcome pad .
the meals are over priced and just ok in terms of quality .
when my husband spoke to the manager , he could care less about it .
so , to anyone reading this , i would look for another breakfast option .
i do not get it .
why does this place get voted best breakfast ?
tried again today and were again sorely disappointed .
after going here for years , boy were we disappointed .
it 's like no one cared any more .
the manager could n't have cared less .
no refills on coffee , and the food was nowhere as good as previously .
it will be a long time before we consider another visit .
not so much here .
i 'm not going to finish it .
hell , i may not even last _num_ bites .
in addition to shitty service is the lack of service to begin with .
you ca n't eat pancakes with your hand .
speaking of coffee , their coffee is brutal .
then i realized they serve royal cup coffee .
this is the kind of coffee you serve to people you hate .
apparently , the management at oph hates their customers .
the joint seems to bring out a giant stack of stupid in people .
instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead .
she ended up sitting on my lap to eat .
it was an okay experience - sure was n't what i expected .
i was n't too impressed with my visit here .
the potatoes i ordered were extremely salty and had very little flavor .
pancakes and bacon horrible .
most recently , i went here on a sunday for brunch with my family .
the chicken sandwich i ordered was awful .
i just sat there for _num_ minutes while my party ate their food .
nice courts , but horrible communication about the courts being reserved .
the quality of the clothing was pathetic and most of the items were ugly .
the layout is terrible !
horrible customer service .
once again , horrible customer service !
what a complete waste of time .
terrible customer service at the cafe over the weekend .
also they had problems with their soda machine .
he never spoke to a single black customer .
the atmosphere is less friendly .
next time we want greek food , we 'll go to the mad greek .
a little more pricey but it caught my eye .
except maybe on small business saturday .
i have spent thousands of dollars at this store .
went a second time and did not have a great experience .
sat in a different seat and that seat did n't work as well .
pedicure turned out good , but manicure not so much .
i wo n't be going back .
can i rate less than a star ?
so we got up and walked out .
not fair to the customer at all .
i ended up with square shaped nails that were mediocre at best .
you can guarantee i will never step foot in this place again .
she did not apologize nor did she take me seriously .
the sales staff ( if you can call them that ) were complete snobs .
later i am still dealing with their screw ups .
ordered a very a very large and heavy coat rack .
we could not get it together because it did n't line up .
wow , were has customer service gone ?
walked in and no one never said hello .
good thing i was n't a secret shopper .
overly expensive attorney who will not deliver any results !
do not make the same mistake that i did !
i was in there _num_ minutes before anyone spoke with me .
an older man that works there stared at me and never spoke .
however , they will not get my money .
so let me go over this : i have a coupon .
i do n't have that coupon .
me - _num_ , her - _num_ .
_num_ of us that i know were sized wrong .
customer service was terrible .
after we purchased our suits they would not correct it .
highly recommend not buying a suit here .
these people do not know what they 're doing .
when we walked in , no one greeted us or even looked at us .
not helpful at all !
terrible experience !
the lady almost asked for the double price after doing the job .
she had to argue and explain but still end up paying $ _num_ extra .
would not recommend .
this place is below average when it comes to service & pizza 's .
disappointed every time i 've gone ... wo n't be trying it anymore !
what a disappointment .
the service was sooo slow .
we ordered two seafood entrees , two beers , and an order of sushi .
meeting our friends there for a sunday bite was nice .
that 's the only reason i 'm giving this place _num_ stars .
on top of that , none of the shrimp had been cleaned .
that 's beyond gross and completely unacceptable for a seafood restaurant of that caliber .
with all the other choices out there - we probably wo n't be back .
disappointing .
overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms .
typical south side snob crap .
spicy tuna rolls were not fresh and smelled like fish .
california rolls lacked flavor and were quite bland .
i can not comment on the main courses as we did not have any .
gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed .
while tasty , the portions are small .
unfortunately , the best part of this restaurant is the valet service .
bad decision .
bad service .
food was bland & ill prepared .
what a disappointment .
once our dinner came , everything went downhill .
for a place that seems so classy , the experience surely was not .
did n't feel respected as a customer .
never in my life have i seen someone charge that amount .
they had n't been cleaned properly .
this place is a total disappointment .
it was basically dried out , overly thin and the flavor was not good .
the food was very disappointing .
the goat cheese was nowhere to be found .
the french toast tapas was mediocre .
the egg on my wife 's eggs benedict was over-cooked .
returning to the buffet , my wife said the shrimp was very salty .
( i do n't eat shrimp . )
the desserts were absolutely pathetic .
most were stale .
to say that the dessert selection was uninspired is a severe understatement .
they should have been included in the price of the brunch .
we were not treated as we expected in such an establishment .
the food was not very good to my husband and i .
maybe we had a bad taste in our mouth already .
i went in to ship a package that i needed to return to amazon .
i left with my package and i wo n't be back .
what a terrible customer service !
unbelievably poor customer service .
next stop , the better business bureau .
the weights are limited and they do n't have a lot of machines .
_num_ weeks later i am still waiting on my other shirts .
this is completely unacceptable .
they refuse to do anything about it .
i was told that the equipment failure caused the delay .
i took them back and the cleaners cleaned them for free .
i spent an average of $ _num_ per month on cleaning .
he offered no solution for the shirt that his business ruined .
terrible business .
unfortunately the order was sent to flower hut .
i , like most people , do not answer `` unknown '' phone numbers .
the company was very unprofessional and rude .
i 'm completely disappointed , i ordered my mother-in-law flowers for her birthday .
it was a disaster , a horrible experience .
long story short , what was advertised online looked nothing like what we received .
would not recommend .
the lady that did my nails was so rude .
she never introduced herself or spoke to me the whole time .
the service was awful .
not going back .
nothing special to note about this location of the papa john 's chain .
much better pizza even if they do n't deliver .
this particular location has really let me down !
the breadsticks box had grease leaked all over .
both the pizza and the breadsticks are not the quality i used to .
very unhelpful service and pizzas always arrive 20-30 mins after time given on order .
poor experience at pick up .
highly disappointed all around .
i am in search of a new salon definitely !
if i could give negative stars , i would .
i waited for a while before i called back and there was no answer .
i 'm not kidding .
it gets worse .
she also spent the entire time trying to up sell me .
awful awful .
worst pedicure and gel manicure ever !
$ _num_ worth of services paid for and all of our services was rushed .
the place was clean and pleasant but the food was lacking .
it just wasnt enough food for the price .
service was okay , i 'm pretty sure he was the owner .
the rest of the experience was kind of bizarre .
there was also some take-out business at the same time .
here 's where things got a little weird .
this place was garbage for hookah .
they did n't even change the water and there was ash inside the hose .
i did not set out to write a bad review .
service : initially good
it was not worth the original _num_ dollars charged .
waitress : our food was served with rice and meat .
they charged us on the bill an additional _num_ dollars without telling us .
the deal is kind of fake to bring people here !
and the box for the food is _num_ $ .
let me tell you about the worst shopping experience i 've ever had .
she does n't even look at me , let alone speak to me .
i try calling out to her too , saying `` ms. ?
he is clearly as mad as i am .
somehow i feel like they have served chicken from the day before .
worst customer service .
not worth it .
this place is not that fast ... .
nothing special , basic run of the mill chinese food .
food is n't very good - service is worse .
crab rangoon is soggy .
egg rolls are greasy and flavorless .
this review is n't about the food as much as the service .
we ca n't wait till our lease is up !
do n't waste your time or money .
now my refrigerator is broken does n't keep anything cold but the freezer .
the apartments are n't terrible just not great .
however , i never like my food !
it is always greasy and flavorless .
very disappointed .
walgreens - at least this location - has gone downhill .
way downhill .
a little incompetence i can deal with .
has it come to reviewing fast food joints ?
yes , i wrote a letter , i 'm that guy .
anywho , it went a little something like this .
i stopped on the way to the theatre , to grab a bite .
that 's not good when you 're ordering food .
personal hygiene was n't on the menu that night !
i asked for my money back and left .
i 'm still never setting foot in there ever again .
big mistake .
the fries were soggy and cold .
the two dancers i did see where not all that great looking .
the bartenders appeared to be better looking then the two dancers .
i 'd rather get a lap dance from the bartenders .
i 've never been a big drinker ; over priced beer and soda .
this place really is n't worth the time or money .
well , it 's been better than it is now .
the last two pair did n't come out right .
however , they have let themselves go downhill .
the people are quite possibly the rudest i have ever met .
i have not met anyone there with a personality yet .
walk-in customers will be treated with less effort than existing customers .
it was too late .
a cut through the middle made it impossible to correct .
i requested a firm drive it out quote via email .
still no email quote .
i would stay away from these shady dealers .
the advertised prices were _num_ .
then they offered me the sale at _num_ which they claimed was their cost .
that did n't work so we took it back .
i found it online for just over $ _num_ and i replaced it myself .
that did n't fix it so we took it back again .
they are dishonest and their customer service is terrible .
it is n't that far but your experience will be so much better .
terrible sales staff .
oh , gee , they did n't realize that !
my trade was only worth about half of what carmax said it was ?
first off , i never right reviews unless it 's positive .
your brake pads & shoes have _num_ % left he said .
ca n't mess that up right ?
wrong .
the mechanic says basic .
and i said , my car requires a synthetic blend .
everything that should 've been done is handled miss .
i walked back in and asked the guy if my tires had been rotated .
comes back a minute later and asks for my keys .
i will not be returning to this location .
in addition , requesting potential customers to text you is not professional .
i 'll utilize another tour company during my next charlotte visit .
the rest was mediocre .
the rice was plain , edible with soy sauce .
but overall i wo n't be getting food here again .
smh worst service every ... .
ordered sesame chicken and it came with two pieces of broccoli .
so disgusting , i dont even want to eat my meal anymore .
the sesame chicken sucks .
their chicken wings are so tasteless .
they probably just fry it plain .
do n't waste your time here .
like i mean seriously drive past this place .
i gave this place _num_ visits and each time i was left disappointed .
i will never spend another penny there as long as i live .
the kitchen is in plain view of the customers which is nice .
the service was not very good .
the cashier was not very nice on the phone or in person .
the portions are large and the prices are very inexpensive .
i would recommend the lunch specials such as the hunan shrimp .
although if you are looking for spicy , i would order extra spicy .
my meal was marked as spicy and it was n't at all .
i would eat here again , but not anytime soon .
recently had my son 's 9th birthday party here .
just do n't expect much for a child 's party .
not a fan .
then the fried squash ... not crispy and just mush on the inside .
but ultimately it should be about the food should n't it ?
they even charge you $ _num_ for ice water !
the cole slaw i had was drenched in mayo , like water .
horrible !
my wife had a gyro that she said was just ok .
the only thing good were the french fries , which were hot .
avoid at all costs !
did n't even ask for my money back i was so disgusted .
lots of things were bad here .
this was n't during peak hours .
there were only two other customers in the entire restaurant .
the hamburger steak was ok .
the squash was flavorless .
the batter was crispy and the squash was soggy on the inside .
my bf said his shrimp was ok at best .
_num_ stars was being generous .
it was so dry that it was impossible to eat without liquid .
it turns out this was a terrible idea .
it was a very weird situation for us .
first off , it was gross .
i probably would have complained , but we decided instead to pay and leave .
they really have nothing here i ca n't get somewhere i like better .
right at _num_ , glasses were given out to a few tables around us .
the entire experience was fairly upsetting for being an avid fan of this place .
slow service .
horribly under staffed .
they were not busy , _num_ tables in the whole place .
very disappointed after reading the other reviews .
service was lacking and food came out wrong .
no offer to comp food and no apology .
would not recommend this restaurant to anyone !
however , the wait staff and food is below average .
our service was slow .
i 'm skeptical though .
meanwhile she neglected refills , messed up food orders , and forgot drink orders .
if you are going for food check the score before you walk in !
i was all ready to give this place a good review .
very poor experience .
lack of professionalism with the management staff .
we will not visit this location again .
the only flying you should be doing here is flying right past the place .
the place was not packed , and the servers were not busy at all .
i will not be back .
this location is no exception to that rule .
it is open _num_ hours .
a breakfast place that has been in the area a long time .
i went and the service was ok , nothing special .
the environment did n't seem the cleanest .
the food was very basic and a little greasy .
i would not go back for any reason .
( at this point , i was slightly annoyed ) .
from start to finish , this was a miserable experience .
i was scheduled to bring my car in but it would not start .
the actual body work seemed okay , i did n't closely inspect it .
this review is no different .
unacceptable .
so i ended up taking whatever she could find .
otherwise , i 'm switching to national or avis .
i wish we had video cameras to record the absurd service we received .
( which i did ) i waited for _num_ mins before the bus arrived .
if you hated your job that much just quit .
pay the extra dollar or _num_ per day and stay away .
however , the people who run this location are entirely incompetent .
third problem : they gave us no inspection paperwork .
the manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate .
fifth problem : i called and emailed customer service about my charge .
consider this your fair warning .
if i could give this company zero stars , i would .
_num_ words : unorganized chaos .
one of the worst rental experiences of my life .
waited over a hour for them to process _num_ rentals .
the line behind me very long and no concession was offered .
barely had enough power to go up a hill and still maintain highway speed .
next time it avis or anyone else beside hertz .
employees behind the counter would disappear for _num_ , _num_ minutes with no explanation .
_num_ minutes later , i was given a car in the gold parking area .
i 've never been treated so poorly .
avoid this place !
if i had known that i would n't have added the second driver .
this is clearly a rip off .
( they never responded to an email i sent shortly after the incident . )
but they 've lost my business for good .
do n't get scammed like i did .
avoid hertz and go with a reputable company instead .
what a lousy experience .
the car was nice , the service was terrible .
can i give zero stars ?
worst hertz location experience i have ever had .
the car i reserved was not in my gold space so i went inside .
i waited _num_ minutes for the right car .
he said no to free upgrade .
not a great hertz location and they need much better signage and training .
car was ok otherwise .
i am a gold member at hertz .
they did n't seem to care .
the worst hertz location i 've dealt with !
worst service ever !
even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car .
so no inspection upon return , guys ?
ugh .
they really need to change their system here .
car seats were dirty and old .
they have the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
never again will i rent from them .
do n't waste your money .
what a disaster -- so bad it hurts .
_num_ minute wait in line to exit the rental car location .
no cars .
no service .
takes terribly long although i am gold member .
name is not listed on the board .
it took _num_ min to get the car .
having worked in the rental business i knew she was n't telling the truth .
rent from somebody else if you have the choice .
bad service , bad cars , not recommended .
total failure .
avoid !
flights we 're canceled so i needed to drive _num_ hours home .
the attendants were in their small stations and would not scan my vehicle .
the line was barely moving !
_num_ minutes later i was able to return my vehicle .
on my first the front desk persons were slow , unfriendly and grumpy .
drove locally around charlotte for two days and used about 1/4 tank .
i was charged $ _num_ for a full tank and service .
three reps gave me codes that did not work .
horrible .
gave my family a car and the next day the battery was dead .
it takes forever to get the problem fixed and a new car .
horrible treatment .
the worst management team ever .
their vehicles are dirty and smelly .
word to the wise , choose another company if at all possible .
_num_ minute wait for a car i reserved a month ago ?
ridiculous .
never again will i rent from this hertz .
yet another hertz location that does n't have cars for reservations .
ridiculous wait as they make us sit here waiting for returns to come in .
i have probably rented from over a _num_ different hertz locations .
the shuttle driver just sits there and does not help in anyway .
so the super rude gold counter lady called over the supervisor .
i will never rent form this hertz again .
this is the busiest rental car place ive ever been at .
no darling it was not your rental car .
it was kind of confusing .
very , very slow service .
find another rental car service at charlotte airport .
lousy scratched up car .
this service really sucks .
reservations are not honored even if prepaid .
drop off was better than pick up , but that 's not saying much .
the worst service and slowest employees i 've ever seen .
i would give it zero stars if i could .
i showed up and had reserved a full size car .
not really what i would call a full size , but that 's fine .
the whole experience was terrible .
that was not ideal .
disaster !
hertz would not honor the reservation we had made over _num_ weeks ago .
so far ... not so good .
be a gold member so you do n't waste any more time .
the worst place to rent a car from !
must wait almost _num_ hours for a car and they do n't care !
most of the counter employees are rude or cold and not helpful .
quite possibly the slowest moving place on earth .
took over _num_ mins to get a car .
does n't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient ?
avoid this one if you can .
do not rent here .
do n't bother asking for management .
no , no , and no !
seriously i wished i would have wasted more time there .
maybe it 's just hertz .
_num_ degrees , line out the door , and no ac .
awful experience , do not rent here !
and i mean all day .
i even cut up my gold membership card already .
i was there on vacation and went to pick up my rental car .
i gave them my credit card and they said it was declined .
just to rent a car for _num_ hrs ?
he did not care one bit .
rented a car on the way back for $ _num_ bucks with budget .
no deposit .
the deposit i was aware of but the $ _num_ i was n't .
my mother had the same experience with the same _num_ companies .
why does it take almost _num_ minutes to get the paperwork .
the inventory was limited .
car was not in the spot .
will not use them again .
grab any car in the lane and drive away .
no soup for you !
unfortunately i can not give less than one .
after around half and hour , the transaction was finally completed .
avoid this disaster .
avoid this terrible hertz .
never again will i use hertz .
they tried to get me to upgrade twice .
this car was not safe , but were _num_ hours from charlotte by now .
so she agreed and said she would get back to me .
two hours later , i called and left another voice mail .
i 'm getting pissed now .
she could clearly see that there was something wrong with this car .
i certainly appreciated her making the adjustment , considering my aggravation and valid concerns .
horrible !
there were other customers of hertz with the same situation as well .
the worst .
they are always rude and i always have issues .
do n't bother .
i was never shown anything of told about the $ _num_ per day charge .
no body ever called me .
i spent _num_ minutes doing that and none had an economy car .
my plane was boarding at 5:30 so that would not work .
however , the car they gave me was complete garbage .
luckily i left myself enough time to just barely make it to my interview .
car did n't work .
_num_ others in same situation .
stay away from hertz .
take it from a five star gold member : avoid this location if possible .
after looking online , i 'm fairly certain that was just plain wrong .
the rental ended up being way more expensive than i had originally thought .
people were not kidding when they said hertz are terrible .
i drove for like _num_ miles .
did n't bring my refill receipts and got charged _num_ .
you are willing to piss off a client and make _num_ dollars .
i 'm going back to enterprise though i have no status with them .
the worse ever do n't use this place .
got through the rentals with no problem .
give me the keys and i 'll find the freaking car for you .
absurd .
another less than impressive showing by hertz .
slow an confused counter staff .
i guess they figured i 'd likely keep it for another week .
woman at gold counter said that they had no more cars in that size .
terrible service ... .
unbelievable .
i do n't hold it against the attendant .
wish hertz was more understanding .
no one came to inspect the car with us , which is frustrating .
the whole thing was frustrating to say the least .
look out for charges for options you did n't actually get .
horrible !
customer service sucks .
they were extremely rude and unprofessional .
just absolutely horrible .
i would give this place a minus _num_ stars if i could .
rented a car over a month ago for our flight into charlotte at 6pm .
none at all .
they put us on a wait list and said _num_ minutes .
it was _num_ hours !
they were not apologetic or anything .
the one lady who told us our car was ready was rude !
we waited another _num_ mins for another car .
worst experience of my life and nothing made it better .
i 'm sure no one at this location cares either !
my whole experience here was unbelievable .
when there were _num_ other counters that people could have been working .
that ridiculous !
why even reserve a car when they are n't going to have it ?
hertz ca n't even do what their whole company is about .
this whole this is just so ridiculous .
do n't come to hertz .
this hertz location is a complete toss up .
plus , the ratio of staff to customers is too low .
showed up in nc for a business meeting .
as soon as we got off the shuttle things turned unorganized .
do not book a rental car through national .
the worst i have ever experienced .
i normally book with enterprise , hertz , and avis .
the counter personnel assured my husband it was no problem to change the reservation .
then handed him the contract stating our daily rate was $ _num_ !
why on earth would anyone pay that kind of money ?
if you do n't like your job , quit .
score , but the hour we took to get there was not worth it .
never again , national .
ppl have been waiting _num_ minutes .
no other reason this facility will deserve anything less than _num_ stars .
no effort at all to help me out .
very disappointed !
i am also disabled and have a service animal .
agent : rude .
manager : rude .
horrible people .
enterprise .
the car did n't have any problem .
worse check-in system yet encountered in my travels .
will not go here again .
my wife and i did n't have the best of labor day week ends .
if we can not pay cash for something , we do not buy it .
no one else would help me .
`` i completely understand your frustration .
stay away from this group of companies .
was quoted $ _num_ and charged $ _num_ .
i 'll be trying hertz next time.
the first time i rented from this location the rep was not very polite .
this time , my car is not clean at all .
also , there is no way the car was washed .
i 'm sorry but that 's just not acceptable .
both the smell and sight were quite disgusting .
very bad customer service , extremely slow .
do n't waste your money or time here .
the absolute worst customer service .
i ordered a quarter pound they gave me a 1/3 pound .
the food was bad !
way too salty , cheese tasted like crap .
the service was pitiful !
the chips were all broken and stale .
skip it !
nothing special about it .
am not going back to this particular one for sure !
i was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada .
the guacamole was tasteless and frozen , previously made .
nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh .
i was disappointed the second time .
not sure if i would go back .
this place is a joke at best .
the wait staff act as if their last job was at the dmv !
horrible service , less than friendly would be putting it mildly !
totally reminded me of a mexican soup nazi attitude !
the food was horrible not authentic mexican restaurant .
tried this place tonight after reading the reviews .
salsa was just okay .
and , they make their enchiladas with white cheese which is not authentic mexican .
staff was not friendly .
the food however was really dry , and not at all authentic .
i have never had anything like this , and there have been bad ones .
very disappointed !
this is not one of them .
hate to say it but i would rather eat at taco bell .
-the bathroom could use some soap and paper towels .
very annoyed with this place .
would have been almost enjoyable if there was service .
got my order wrong .
worst burritos ever .
terrible .
not as good as i used to come before .
i will not eat here again .
that would mostly considered as cheap customers .
i just need to look for another place for my favorite mexican food .
but overall , do n't bother with this hole-in-the-wall .
this is the worst mexican restaurant i have ever been to .
do n't go there ... ... run away !
stick with cold subs .
what we had was just okay -- but barely .
would 've taken _num_ min .
since we had to drive _num_ min with limited time not worth the wait .
imo this was very stupid & we 'll not be using them again .
i could go on forever .
gross , gross , gross !
then there was no elevators .
secondly , this place stinks and everything looks nasty !
the carpet feels so yucky but i did n't bring my flip flops .
the bathtub was extremely dirty .
when returning to bed , i discovered what appeared to be a bed bug .
no apology , no action thus far .
all cities are not the same .
this hotel is billed on-line as a _num_ star hotel .
the tv is outdated and old .
the number of channels is limited .
i recently stayed here through priceline .
i was pretty disappointed .
i felt terrible for this woman .
in particular , do not eat dinner in the depressing restaurant .
the airline put me up in this hotel for the night .
a/c unit was very loud .
for old looking sad food i did n't even want to eat .
there are a couple nicer options nearby that probably do n't cost much more .
this hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere .
also , our damn room key would never work !
i had to walk up and down every time to get it to work again.
this place does n't deserve the business .
cleanliness is not a priority here .
hotwire is the reason for all my problems .
we stayed a week for a conference .
the bathrooms are a little small .
for the record ... its not worth $ _num_ .
if i was paying cash , i would take my business elsewhere .
toilet paper is cheap .
no microwave in room .
second night here the free wifi was not working .
the night staff were very helpful and friendly however the morning staff were not .
after _num_ minutes we get our drink orders taken .
i then start looking for a menu and there is none to be found .
eventually after another _num_ minutes we get menus .
then another _num_ minutes to order our food .
none of our drinks were refilled .
customer service goes a long way and the morning staff were lacking .
they 've got _num_ types to choose from .
parking was easy , but the lot was not well lit .
in my opinion , do your shopping elsewhere .
this is the first and only showmars i 've visited .
there are about _num_ of them in the charlotte area .
i could n't finish it .
the mac and cheese was okay , but oddly a bit bland .
both were completely flavorless .
the tzatziki sauce was okay same with the greek salad .
the food is marginal , and the menu is about _num_ % sandwiches .
sorry showmars .
i stopped by to pick up some dinner after i landed at airport .
i chose your fried steak with green and salad to go .
besides salad , i almost have to throw the rest away .
not to mention the price was about $ _num_ .
we will not be back to this location .
first , they got my order totally wrong .
very slow night only _num_ people there .
then when they arrived with my order , again wrong .
worst of all the food sucked .
it 's a slow night so i took them off the table .
you are open for another _num_ hours .
it gets worse but will leave this review as is .
still searching for a good chinese food place here in charlotte .
horrible customer service , i will never spend another dime in this dive !
we had to flag down another server to get our toast .
it was not good at all .
our food as well was stale , cold , and had zero flavor .
will not return here .
my hubby got sick off this food .
decided to come and give them another try no food on buffet .
it was not .
service sucked food was nasty as i dont know what .
imagine _num_ chinese food menus blowing through the parking lot , not cool .
i do not recommend .
do not recommend at all .
i will never go back to total bond .
communication is horrible !
since the old cards do n't work , payments have n't gone through twice .
there is never poop , pee , or vomit in our house or cars .
that has never happened in our household .
i will never go back to total bond .
told the test would be $ _num_ .
bad service , rude desk clerks , terrible management !
waiting outside our doors at _num_ am to get out when checkout is _num_ .
it was all very dated .
breakfast was free , but nothing special .
the worst hotel experience ever !
a paying customer that will never patronize your business again !
do not attend this college , i repeat do not attend this college .
fuck this place fuck this college , fuck the staff .
i was not impressed !
typical chicken place .
the only plus to the restaurant was the servers .
horribly slow service !
slowest drive thru in charlotte .
i 've been here numerous times with the same results .
slow slow slow and slow !
i 've stopped coming here cause they suck to no end .
the drive threw is always backed up like a clogged toilet .
the slowest and worst quality bojangles in the history of the franchise .
avoid at all costs .
this may be the worst mcdonalds in charlotte .
every time i go there they mess my order up .
was told it would be _num_ hours for a delivery .
took _num_ hours for one pizza to be delivered .
worst pizza hut experience ever .
if their drivers were the best , no one would ever move .
they would just sell all there stuff and buy new on the other end .
sell your furniture or pay anyone off the street before calling these guys .
i called them only to find out my truck had n't even left charlotte .
my move came _num_ days late .
i hate to be negative .
but not good at all .
the worse i have had in a long time .
rice is reheated .
gross !
i order sesame chicken with shrimp fried rice and it was awful !
the chicken was extremely crispy .
the rice was flavorless .
i did n't finish my food .
i threw the entire box away .
how ironic !
and you do n't even deserve that !
the place was nearly empty , which might be a sign of changes .
the bbq was cold and dry .
it just was n't that good .
they may ask you where the food came from ?
my girlfriend ordered the fish along with fries and baked beans .
even after all of that , it still was n't very good .
i really like their fried chicken , coleslaw , potato salad and other dishes .
i 'm no barbeque expert but this food plain did n't taste good .
we drove a long drive to try this bbq .
the food came out cold and not fresh .
the server is clueless .
the ribs themselves are not good .
what saved them was the bbq sauce .
and thats why i 'm giving _num_ stars and not _num_ .
nothing special .
sauce again the thin eastern style .
yes , i am going to make a direct comparison between these two establishments .
and i did n't have as many side choices ?
it smells like an elderly persons home .
no bacon in the green beans ?
i 'm giving it a _num_ star for the food and price .
it literally tasted and looked like everything came out of a old can .
probably the worst bbq food i 've ever had .
i do n't know how else to put it .
but if you can avoid it , you should .
it was $ _num_ for a standard pulled pork plate with a drink .
seriously so bad .
you 're giving nc bbq a bad rep .
just was refused service because we had a large group .
not an option .
empty restaurant , and they would not let _num_ people sit and eat .
their policy is `` no teams '' .
the hostess politely said they have had teams cause problems .
none of these _num_ parents will ever return .
so i ca n't tell you how the food is .
just do n't walk in as a large group .
$ _num_ for a regular size barbecue plate and a ice water !
the place was empty .
i am not an expert but i did n't see the smoky color .
the biggest problem was that the meat was under cooked .
do n't waste your time .
poor service , screwed up orders .
i 'd suggest finding bbq elsewhere .
guy would n't stop talking to us .
food was mediocre .
he was very weird -- asked personal questions that were none of his business .
the coleslaw had too much mustard and was very tangy .
we will not be back .
been here many times due to its close my house .
everyone else is below average .
i 'm here now writing this review and the basketball game is on .
i really hate that !
she did n't smile .
the sandwich was n't good want be going back .
i also smell a rat .
please do n't burn the burgers .
ok maybe this was my first and last time at this waffle house .
the restrooms were disgusting , the food was great .
first off our server acted like she could care less .
the food has gone downhill as well .
they still have potential but i doubt i 'll be returning .
there were three in our party that waited for nearly _num_ minutes .
_num_ minutes .
horrible showers , but nice folks .
stopped here on the way to fort jackson .
i would n't recommend this place .
gross .
who the hell can sleep on a square like that besides a child !
it 's beyond ridiculous and not to mention annoying to try and sleep on .
blah , so much for sleeping inn at sleep inn .
not recommended and officially denied going forward .
i absolutely can not recommend strongly enough against this hotel .
i wish i 'd read these reviews before deciding to stay here .
this in no way makes up for the horrible stench of this place .
i feel dirty just being here .
b. i did not know the electrical outlet did not work .
c. incompetent `` maintenance '' personnel .
d. reception desk : lack of a sense of urgency plus no follow-up .
e. no apology or compensation .
he gave me a confirmation number and everything seemed fine .
i am totally appalled that this would happen .
avoid bad service and disappointment .
do n't waste your time .
overpriced low quality hibachi .
i however made the mistake of staying .
not worth the stomach ache i had the rest of the day .
needless to say , i will not be eating here again .
my boyfriend came with me to eat but was not eating .
it took _num_ minutes for my plate to come out .
take your money elsewhere .
have not been to this location in awhile .
i was very disappointed .
both of us ordered pancakes mine was regular pancakes and my husband was blueberry .
not good .
the little bubble in my head said what does she mean by that response .
did not look like the menu pic .
ca n't believe that they serve us that .
not a fan of this location .
the toast and hash browns were the only items cooked correctly .
overall horrible experience .
the staff is friendly but pushy when it comes to putting in your order .
the place looks really run down and the decor is very outdated .
i 'm never coming back to a denny 's .
if i could give zero stars then i would .
awful service , poor attitude , poor food quality .
_num_ people in lobby waiting while wait staff stand around .
_num_ plate of food for our party comes out while others wait .
cashier checks our card out before we can give tip .
glad i wo n't be coming to this location anymore .
i ordered an avocado chicken caesar salad .
i assumed i was covered for my next refill .
not impressed .
the service is terrible .
instead , i got nothing .
wrong again .
easily the worst cup of coffee i 've ever had .
the service was laughable , and i have zero desire to ever go back .
very frustrating overall .
horrible service .
terrible showroom from _num_ .
poor attitude by employee .
todd 's flowers on central ave is out of business .
in fact , the building where they once occupied has been torn down .
so i asked for two pints , nope , out of pints too .
not super bad service , but i 've certainly had better .
associate was indifferent to my presence the day i went in .
no greeting , no offer of assistance .
i will not purchase with this company .
i do not like this company .
headed to backyard pools the next time i need something pool related .
ordered my pizza tonight via website .
when order came , plain cheese pizza .
this is the worst pizza store in charlotte .
as the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude .
do n't waste your money .
this place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else .
i only rated _num_ star because i could n't select a half or none .
placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told _num_ minutes .
ruined our panthers football game !
never ordering from pizza hut again .
did n't expect much from pizza hut .
do n't waste your time here , try a local place instead !
avoid like the plague !
i could have saved _num_ % off the price of my food .
i ca n't rate it at zero stars ...
wish i could give this negative _num_ stars .
the girl disappeared and no worker came out for about _num_ min .
and why did you wait all that time to tell me ?
this place clearly had no care for customer service or business .
unbelievable that they 're still in business .
i should have stayed home and made pizza myself .
it has been _num_ .
bad service .
this is unfortunately the one that delivers to my house .
this location is the worst and has been for years .
i tried to get a delivery on _num_ separate occasions .
sigh ... never ordering from them again .
sadly , this is the only pizza hut near me .
often answers the orders totally lacks something .
so , yeah , thankfully there are plenty of other pizza places near by .
these guys has the seeds to call and leave a message to call back .
if it was about the pizza you were n't getting it back .
my shrimp dumplings were only ok , and frankly tasted previously frozen .
the highlight of the meal actually was dessert .
on the whole , a major disappointment .
i could n't hear the people at my own table it was so loud .
i have only been there once but probably wo n't go again .
spinach side was a little bitter .
manager never came back to tell us that all were reserved for others .
needless to say , we did not stay .
on my second visit here , i had a very unpleasant experience .
awful awful awful !
i have never experienced such rude nurses or doctor in my life .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i ended up leaving and going to cvs clinic instead .
staff was nice , pedicure was horrible .
it seriously looked like a little kid did it .
the music is horrible , but most sport bars have that trend .
stopped by tonight with a friend .
my friend 's beer had a due date of november _num_ .
i returned my beer and ordered a draft .
it 's wrong again .
the salads on the menu sound good but taste awful .
my husband did not care for his meal either .
he got buffalo tacos and the tortilla 's were not even warm .
went for lunch with family ( wife and _num_ young boys ) .
how can you mess up a hot dog ?
we probably wo n't be coming back to this location .
there were waitresses everywhere , and it seemed _num_ or _num_ managers .
the food was mediocre , except the salmon .
high prices , watered down drinks , impersonal management .
it was way better !
it 's like a bad applebee 's .
ps - hiring high school aged girls as `` hostesses '' is almost creepy .
then again - the place is creepy .
this location is n't consistent .
there is one lady that works at the drive thru that is so rude .
i ca n't stand it .
i 'm not a fan .
the associates are slow and rude .
i just felt like i was being questioned .
the food quality was garbage she undercooked the hash browns as well .
ordered _num_ burgers and a soda .
i have no one to blame but myself .
the service here is almost always terrible .
the employees , by and large , could care less about customer service .
none of the machines seemed to work properly at all .
the games that did give you tickets were cheap as hell .
shame on you !
your lucky to get a _num_ out of _num_ !
also , there were _num_ games that were not working .
this chuck e cheese had the rudest manager i have ever encountered .
this location was completely overcrowded and dirty .
it was also annoying to us since this place is not cheap .
they had soooo many birthday celebrations going on as well .
the employees were not kind or helpful .
we will not be back .
the service pretty much sucked .
as my son said their `` legendary sweet tea '' was n't very legendary .
it tasted old and not very sweet .
to top it off the place looked and smelled dirty .
pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there .
it was just a waste of $ _num_ because we could n't eat it .
they probably wo n't get my business again !
_num_ hours before close and i asked for the grilled chicken bites .
i almost left but just ordered fried chicken tenders and too salty fries .
this was probably the worst bojangles i 've ever been to .
sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber .
visited two years ago and got chicken that was raw inside .
person behind counter was apathetic and did not seem surprised at all .
no apology , just want some different chicken ?
got my money back and left .
was n't even nice enough to bring them to me .
slowest drive thru in the whole world .
but typical for the entire bojangles chain .
terrible service .
sadly i havent got my food quicker than _num_ minutes at this location .
the employees seem nice and all but i have never seen service so slow .
drive thru too damn slow !
it 's not appealing at all and the eggs smell just like grease .
you people never fail to simply make an order correct !
this crap has happened at least _num_ times in a row !
this is the only bojangles i 've ever had a problem with .
this place is terrible !
next we were told to pull up , worst thing you can agree too .
there was already a car waiting .
of course , it was not what we wanted , the club .
this one is poorly run .
i had to wait _num_ min in the drive thru for a supreme combo .
i am done with second chances for this location and will not be returning .
her response , i 'm waiting on biscuits .
it was terrible , terrible service .
hands down the worst drive thru experience of my life .
we ordered a bbq sandwich with no coleslaw and a _num_ piece tender meal .
and it 's pretty gross inside .
the service was friendly and the beer is cold .
the chicken & rice soup was pretty bland .
a friend of mine had a philly cheesesteak that used ground beef .
food is a bit over priced and nothing to write home about .
i was uncomfortable the majority of the time i was there .
so , why did i only give them two stars ?
absolutely the worst bar i 've been to .
trashy , nasty and extremely rude staff .
i 've been here about _num_ other times through the year .
there 's plenty other spots with a lot friendlier staff in charlotte .
when we came back my best friends iphone was no longer on the table .
will not be returning .
there were _num_ people total sitting at the bar including our party .
she ( the employee ) left without paying her tab .
`` you know i 'm a good person ill pay you back . ''
and walked away .
weak drinks .
and rude staff .
no class at this place .
things sure went downhill after that !
and that is just annoying .
the bathrooms are still disgusting .
the interior was updated and looks a little cleaner but it 's nothing special .
the drinks are so weak it 's appalling .
it was n't overly crowded , but it was n't dead either .
i had to scream to someone a foot away from me to be heard .
what made it especially awkward - no one was breaking it down .
do n't try to pretend you 're something else .
plus side , our waitress ( kim ) was pretty awesome .
it was empty in there but service was still a little slow .
after a lengthy wait our food came out and mine was all wrong .
the gave me fried tenders and fries oops !
i said no fries and naked tenders means grilled .
so no i wo n't be going back .
i quickly changed my order to buffalo wings .
the sauce was mediocre and one wing ( boneless ) was actually just breading .
even with $ _num_ groupon for $ _num_ its still overpriced ... ... .
okay .
overall , not worth it .
same dcor which we like but a new menu .
no longer are available are the thai spring rolls with peanut sauce .
menu description is poor though .
i called a bit late and they only had _num_ pm open .
a little uncomfortable but no problem .
you could n't see the table there was so much food .
i was pissed !
i do n't care how good your food is .
oh wan fu , you were a big disappointment .
after that was taken , our food came out very quickly !
my husband and i have been going to wan fu for years .
the worst was yesterday at lunch , they mixed up our order .
they did not thank us when paying or leaving as they usually do .
it was very rude .
the kitchen was poorly managed and the staff was struggling to handle the demand .
they had no idea how long it would take .
the food was bland .
it was over cooked & the sauce was more soy like than smooth .
i have found a restaurant that i hate and is this one .
hate the atmosphere , so dark during the day .
the food is terrible .
thought i would give it another shot after a previous bad experience .
if you are only familiar with mall chinese maybe you would like this place .
ca n't say the same for the quality of the food .
either they do n't carry it or i could n't find it .
its downright awful and has been for awhile .
so bad i have walked out and i have seen others do the same .
however , the employees in the meat department are very rude .
however , i decided not to purchase it from this store .
if i acted the way these employees did , i would lose my job .
and on my third trip i made $ _num_ .
i immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated .
it was an awful experience .
i wasted my gas and my time .
and i 've never had to wait longer than _num_ minutes .
nothing overly nice , about the same as a yard sale , but pricier .
staff is rude & snotty with `` comments '' .
they have always have an excuse why they ca n't `` accept '' something .
i walked in _num_ girls stood behind the counter not one offered to help .
she told me it would be _num_ minutes .
when they paid for my stuff the girl pretty much threw my money down .
in regards to the polish change , it was a complete disaster .
the customer next to me asked three more times very nicely for the water .
very poor service and i was completely unimpressed .
`` kelly '' is rude .
needless to say i will not be going back .
total waste of money !
this place is empty .
apparently they do n't like business .
no way will i be back any time soon .
the line was endless and crowded .
my husband orders the calamari and i ordered the lobster bisque .
i was n't all that impressed with it .
it was so nasty , we did n't finish our salads .
my husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it .
i ordered crme brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream .
my husband had a little better luck with his than i did .
we get our bill and come to find out it 's $ _num_ .
we went here for restaurant week and it was yuck , just yuck .
i do n't know why i keep going back to this place .
when we first got in , there was nobody at the hostess station .
just ok ? ''
she said no , we got our check , and left .
my lasagna was a $ _num_ meal at best .
my wife said her 's was priced decently but had no flavor .
i was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth .
the second bite was stringy steak .
overall it was n't a bad sandwich at all .
i was disgusted .
very disappointed .
oven was n't working so no pizzas available .
over priced for average , below average food .
not impressed .
the answer is try harder to find a source because they are out there .
the cauliflower was good but there spinach all i tasted was vinegar .
the fruit was n't ripe and over all the experience was just bad .
i am sure i will not be returning .
the biggest rip-off ever .
however , no matter what you will always find a bad store .
i ordered a combo they made a mistake and gave me the wrong sandwich .
i was on break i did not have time to go back that day .
therefore i addressed it the next day they refused to fix it .
bad customer service they just do not care at this location .
i do n't have to eat here , have n't been back since .
the doctor said it was nothing .
all the doctor could say was `` hmmm , that 's really weird '' .
i took my dog in got his medication , it cleared up immediately .
i agreed and scheduled the surgery for wednesday .
not a _num_ % credit .
but i will not take her someplace that runs a scam like this .
the staff is unorganized and it is incredibly difficult to reach a doctor .
i would not recommend anyone to take their pet to this facility .
i 'm only giving _num_ stars because the optometrist was fine .
last time i ordered contacts , the wrong prescription was sent home with me .
ok , but that is n't what i wanted to do .
she 's obnoxious .
unfortunately that is where the good news stops !
and they looked at me like i had _num_ heads .
she did not return my call , so i called again .
a rip off of you ask me .
this is the worst place i have ever lived in all my years !
i will be filing a bbb complaint as well against this terrible management company !
we also have a horrible neighbor problem .
didnt really seem like the cared either .
no one came to check the unit for mold .
they told me they wont give me the corporate number .
they ca n't seem to tell me anything .
i just want to be done with these apartments .
worst apartments ever .
i shrugged it off and called maintenance .
sure they took a few days and gave me light bulbs .
they did n't even fix it .
to this day it continues to peel off and it is disgusting .
the next issue is that these walls are paper thin .
i 'm sorry , what ?
do n't sign a lease with these jerks .
ultimately you will get screwed over .
literally the worst apartment complex .
_num_ weeks later and nothing has been done .
we 've requested work orders _num_ weeks ago and still nothing has been done .
horrible food .
the huge problem is the teppanyaki ... just awful .
i ate there over the christmas holidays .
- the chicken was so salty it was inedible .
only a _num_ year old could be comfortable eating here .
just crap .
- i did n't say anything because my relatives have friends who work there .
if not for this , i 'd have talked to the manager .
the food was awful and the presentation was worse .
it 's really gone downhill .
the quality of all there food simply was not there .
the japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in charlotte .
my to go meal ended up being $ _num_ bucks after taxes and tip .
the meat were tasteless and dry and so were the veggies !
they definately wo n't be getting my business again !
average japanese steakhouse experience .
staff was very friendly ( hostess , waitress and chef ) .
i wo n't be back .
well it 's not the place it use to be .
that stuff is nasty .
dude get over it and go make your ring of fire .
i had the fillet , scallops and shrimp .
the restaurant is run down , and not cleaned thoroughly .
that is not cool .
the place was shabby and the floor was filthy .
he could n't save the day , though .
i would not return , and i can not recommend .
i believe he is a sushi chef and certainly lacks management skills .
the service was n't bad , and the presentation was typical .
just nothing special .
first off , i sat in the sushi bar area .
i have not eaten in the dinner area yet .
i just know better sushi places .
they had a crappy and small sake selection and their cheapest bottle was _num_ .
also i had to get a new soy sauce bowl .
i was _num_ minutes late , no need to yell .
probably will only go back for take out .
but how does a japanese hibachi not know what an unagi roll is ?
so not worth it .
staff were not as attentive as other restaurants .
very pricey and they automatically add _num_ % gratuity with your bill .
we will never go back here sadly .
if you want an authentic hibachi experience , this is not the place .
good for kids , bad for people who appreciate good japanese food .
the restaurant was not busy so we should not have been so rushed .
it was very unprofessional .
horrible !
the entire staff was hispanic , not japanese .
i just expected a nicer meal for that kind of money .
i felt extremely uncomfortable there , and the buffet was not worth its price .
the naan bread was like a rubber sheet .
they never bothered to refill the bread basket .
the chicken curry was passable .
chicken tikka masala was below average .
the only thing they bothered to refill was water .
were somewhat disappointed ( probably due to higher expectations ) .
the overall experience seemed somewhat disappointing .
but starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill .
bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite .
probably one of the worst indian food i have ever had in usa .
went there for sunday buffet and the food was terrible .
serving is bad and avoid this restaurant .
one of the worst indian meals we have had in a long time .
- lamb kabobs - undercooked and falling apart .
no excuse .
a big f for this .
tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish .
one can understand , this is charlotte and thus not a indian food destination .
but the miss on simple kabobs clearly show a careless staff .
in my opinion , a waste of money .
service was average to bad .
food quality left a lot to be improved .
meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy .
overall i do n't recommend it and wo n't be going back at all .
our waiter was friendly , he came to refill our waters twice .
i was a bit disappointed in the selection .
i am a vegetarian , so i was already limited in my choices .
their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate .
food has never made me feel that way .
in my opinion , this is an americanized indian restaurant .
by the time i had some , it was cold , chewy and blah .
no spices or raisin and naan .
not satisfied !
worst indian food i have ever eat in us .
it was horrible .
the spread is average , quality of food and service unimpressive .
saw a huge roach on the wall .
no apologies or comment as we were paying the bill .
wish i could give it less .
ridiculous is how to best describe the buffets .
cold , bland and that 's even if you get to see some food .
only _num_ other _num_ person tables there .
i only wish i had taken a picture of the buffet to prove it .
do n't say i did n't tell you so .
anyway i 'm sure they will be closed soon .
i just came from lunch with coworkers here .
ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables , was served the shrimp and broccoli .
probably all the same sauce anyway .
shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer .
and now i 'm craving fortune cookie .
i 'm so sad right now .
well everything was kinda disappointing .
no bueno , not for me .
next time ill pass .
from there , sadly , it began to go downhill .
also he asked me if i wanted a menu ... ... strange .
cold , hard and greasy .
panda 's den in north charlotte puts this place to shame .
the hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together .
i know they just walked in ahead of me .
first impression : the place is old and in need of some updates .
two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls .
one person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered .
the waitress did offer to get the fried rice .
it tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt .
the egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt .
i had eaten here before and it was much better in the past .
so they great wall is not so great .
maybe just have some soup for lunch .
sad to say i wo n't take friends here again .
horrible customer service !
she was waited on before us and no apology was given .
never have experienced anything like this before !
will not be going back to give them any of my money !
what great wall of china south serves is cheap , frozen egg rolls .
i wo n't be back .
absolutely horrible experience .
so we ate our apps and still no one .
had to wait forever for our check .
the crab rangoons were simply not crab rangoons .
there was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever .
i am not sure what they were , but not what i was expecting .
just disgusting .
no idea why this place was full .
many great chinese restaurants around , this is not one .
this place is bad !
the service is bad , the food is bad and the prices are high !
the only thing i enjoyed was the wonton soup !
such a waste of money and time.
worst chinese food ever !
no go .
the location , atmosphere , and service were all good so no complaints there .
the food however was not .
gone downhill .
service was awful .
when finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste .
my husband and i went this past saturday for dinner .
because i usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go .
i was wrong .
the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired , the hosts are great .
okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting .
the sauce tasted old and i could n't even stomach to eat it .
have n't been there in about _num_ years and man has it changed .
the hot and sour soup is exactly that .
the place was n't too crowded for a lunch hour so that was nice .
i wo n't get another certificate for this restaurant .
mainly because the service was horrible .
which was n't deserved at all .
so yes i gave it a two star rating because of service .
and that 's not what we got .
no wonder they are on groupon !
nothing stood out about them whatsoever .
i 'm only writing this to save someone else from wasting money .
it was very soupy and did not have any noodles ?
the onion pancake was incredibly dry .
poor service and okay food .
nothing special to write about .
if they did n't have half price groupons , i would never eat here .
went back yesterday after passing over for several years .
used to be one of my favorite places .
will admit beverage glasses were kept full , but nor a single pleasant gesture .
again not a real problem just one part of the entire experience .
how can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls .
the sesame chicken was terrible .
i had a groupon so i check this place out .
the rice was burnt and the beef and broccoli was very salty .
the next time i went was for a lunch on saturday .
and honestly there is nothing special here .
the service was lacking , the check was dropped off right after the food .
the place did seem busy , which i think is because of the groupon .
the food is seriously lacking .
my hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor .
the shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp .
it is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant .
there was not one thing that i would even recommend to anyone .
it was all so blah .
i had not seen it before but though it looked very quiet .
so i only ordered lunch .
first no spoon or soy sauce .
then the egg roll was soggy .
they did not even cook it fresh .
it was so bad .
the egg drop soup had no flavor either .
the manager said i can take _num_ % off of your bill !
thanks but no thanks !
i have not been back .
went to thai house on a thursday around 8pm .
i did n't see any shrimp , not even mini shrimp .
the pad thai was n't bad ... not great , but not bad .
i 'm not sure if i 'll go back to thai house .
to use up a groupon , we had dinner there last night .
my roast duck was a little misleading considering it was more fried than roasted .
the same or better is available elsewhere .
red curry was very thin , which should not be the case .
it should be thicker than what i ate .
beef pieces were small .
overall the portion to price ratio is poor .
duck curry was okay .
i would not recommend this item if same is prepared again .
fried shrimps were below average .
any household can prepare those at home without much efforts .
as an exception to other thai restaurants , attendant lady was courteous .
i would not recommend to visit second time .
i do n't pay such a high price for ambiance .
i 'm not a fan really .
so i decided to try thai house again as my craving was strong .
which that was the least of my worries but it was n't any good .
it 's supposed to have chicken , clear noodles , and mixed vegetables .
essentially for me , it 's like fast food quality .
_num_ for beef basil ?
skip this place .
it was a big disappointment !
the service here is horrible !
we never got asked if we needed anything else and received no water refill .
it was dried and crusty like its been sitting out for too long .
big disappointment on that dish .
i ate it just because i was hungry .
the decor in the restaurant was nice though .
perhaps the main chef was not working on the weekday night i was there .
not likely to try again though .
and my husbands roasted chicken was frozen in the inside but cooked through ?
i am _num_ months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here .
secondly , it was not that great .
it was mediocre curry at best .
so , goodbye $ _num_ curry .
i did n't save the leftovers .
i always keep my university thai house leftovers for a second meal .
my chicken pad thai tasted too sweet .
the noodles were overcooked and mushy .
the spring roll is slightly burnt and the chicken rubbery .
disappointing because we were looking for a good thai place in charlotte .
very little chicken in both the soup and the drunken noodle .
i 'm sad because this was my favorite thai restaurant .
i had a really negative experience ordering takeout from here .
the pad thai itself was really disappointing .
the noodles were so over-cooked that they were falling apart into tiny pieces .
i ate about a third of it and threw the rest away .
very bad service .
waited _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .
oh , and we did ask to order many times , but just ignored .
below average and i will not return .
like many successful restaurants this one too - tanks .
when all else fails this place was so reliable .
not anymore i guess .
i gave it a try and i was really disappointed .
it tasted exactly like watered down ketchup .
however , we had the papaya salad as an appetizer and that was great .
went tonight and ordered pad thai .
disgusting .
they have switched sauces , the usual peanut sauce was missing .
in its place was a watered down ketchup sauce .
we also ended up with _num_ waitresses .
not impressed , left hungry .
she was slow , rude , and incompetent .
i will not be back to this clinic again .
this is by far the worst .
never ... have my prescriptions ever been ready on time .
when i called in to let them know , they did n't even care .
i 'm actually sorry i ever even ate there .
terrible .
no wonder this place was empty on at _num_ in the evening .
needless to say , there are plenty if better options around .
the first time i got to the car and checked - it was wrong .
there was dead silence , i asked again and she hung up on me !
i had my reservations about stopping at this location tonight .
i will not be back !
you wo n't get what you order anyway , so go anywhere else .
because that was the rude person taking my order .
then i was confused .
this is the only chinese restaurant i like in charlotte .
u can find all the yummy food on the authentic menu .
my favorite is the beef noodle and the pig feet .
the owner is different now and the new menu sucks !
just like other yucky american chinese restaurant now !
tried a different chinese restaurant in the area and wish i did not .
got shrimp with mixed vegetables .
also got the teriyaki beef which was like shoe leather ( very tough ) .
will not be going back .
hot and sour soup was bland .
crispy noodles were stale .
my girlfriend is a vegetarian so one can imagine this ruined her dinner .
certainly will not return to quick wok .
i was very disappointed in the food here .
it sucks that this is the closest chinese restaurant in our area .
food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry .
the food is actually fairly mediocre .
i went here for a nostalgic feeling , but the food was shabby .
i will never use lowe 's for installation ever again .
now , a week later , i have lost all patience .
very poor service .
waited _num_ mins at the paint counter with no acknowledgement of my presence .
john at the paint counter could use some customer service training .
i am going to give up on lowes .
worst experience !
it was an overall bad experience here .
the service was slow and the food was tasteless .
i would probably not return here .
the wait was over _num_ minutes and the waiter was next to the worst .
if i wanted to i could buy this place .
today however i think was not a great experience .
the food was ok , but the service was lacking .
terrible !
just spent $ _num_ for two people at lunch .
cost was $ _num_ .
looked nothing like the picture .
wo n't be doing lunch here again .
our entrees arrived about _num_ minutes after the salad .
she had smoked wings with ranch dressing , they arrived with barbecue sauce .
it was over cooked and tasteless .
this time was n't so great .
daughter ordered classic burger with fries and our appetizer was the new fried pickles .
the pickles came out fast and were very hot .
finally the entrees come and low and behold my pasta is the regular way .
slowest server i have ever had .
i am so disappointed .
poor service , especially during slow times .
my stomach had turned at this point so i said `` no . ''
all the waitresses know me and stop by and talk .
avoid this place if you value your health !
the fries were horrible .
i stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest .
they were full except one table that the guests behind me quickly claimed .
she offered no further help and i offered no further business .
would 've been so simple to just acknowledge me and offer some service .
i 'm not even sure where to start .
horrible !
park _num_ cafe is under new management .
our order required _num_ ... so no that 's not ok .
well scratch the quick now .
as usual it was mediocre at best .
to be honest i was offended and just shook my head .
you used to be ok but now you just do n't care anymore .
you no longer deserve my business .
this was an awful experience .
it was cold had a horrible flavor a lot of fat on the chicken .
and to top it off there was n't even an egg roll .
bad food , horrible service .
place is garbage .
we waited a long time for our courses and forever for our check .
we would n't have tipped that much based on the above comments .
very busy place for rather mediocre food .
the salad dressing was okay , but missing something .
i ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor .
the meat itself did not taste good .
it was n't spoiled tasting , more like a really cheap cut of meat .
i only ate about three bites .
it was very watery and bland : ( .
major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit !
the positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly .
i can not imagine complaints about portion size !
moderately busy , but seated right away .
wo n't be returning .
given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail .
you can tell they use cheap steak and lobster .
the sauces are not good and they are constantly rushing you .
i literally had my soup and salad delivered within _num_ seconds of each other .
then the chef comes out to rush us .
the chef was entertaining but the food was n't very good .
large portions of noodles and vegetables .
i guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality .
does n't work .
that is just wrong .
it 's not very good .
did i mention the hostesses were rude ?
very disappointing .
too expensive for what you get .
a lot of veggies very little steak or chicken .
i felt like i had wasted my hard earned money .
the server and chef were very efficient and personable .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
i feel like i wasted my hunger , time , and money .
wo n't go back .
salon has changed hands ( again ) and not for better .
why was n't i told that before i wasted _num_ minutes ?
( repeat , repeat .
so i left -- for good .
i had one of my worst dining experiences here ever .
i refused to eat while my companion 's ate .
this is the worst restaurant i have ever not eaten at in charlotte !
across the board , the dishes were flavorless .
could n't be further from the truth .
i was really disappointed in this place .
i had heard it was good , but the food was terrible .
it did n't even taste like pad thai .
no flavor .
i will not be coming back here .
we ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed !
curry fried rice was also bland , luckily we have sriracha at home .
again the curry fried rice is not authentic neither .
we will not order from this place again , sorry .
vegetarian lunch was bland .
it did n't get any better with salt .
the decor was outdated and looked drab .
the lighting was nonexistent , we were basically eating in the dark .
i was greatly disappointed when it arrived .
for $ _num_ i was expecting something not quite so gross .
i would n't recommend this restaurant .
this is the worst thai food i have ever had .
they have new and used books , all separated into their various sections .
the portions are pretty small , and sauces are bland .
other than that , i would not recommend .
a takeout place in a supermarket ?
no thanks .
sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times , you miss out .
i 've never lucked out here .
it 's so crammed and so messy .
floor was sticky .
service was not in any rush .
so rude and painfully slow .
at the speaker i waited _num_ full minutes & said `` hello ? ''
as politely as i could .
they said that the meat was kind of tough and dry .
if you asked me if i 'd return , i 'd probably say no .
they have me a baked potato .
i also ordered _num_ breads with it and only received one .
she ended up paying $ _num_ .
what an insult .
worst customer experience of my life .
the amount of time to get service was completely unacceptable .
my husband was afraid to eat it in the fear of getting sick .
i used to really like outback in nj but i 'm in nc now .
it was dry and well done plus it was small for the price .
i denied the managers offer to send it back .
disappointing .
sad too i used to love outback .
it 's a real shame .
really disappointed .
the shrimp was just gross .
i order sirloin and grilled prawns .
the guy waiter was not much nicer .
he was rude and had no interest in serving us .
i have been going to this outback for _num_ years .
i will never visit this location again and will also write outback personally .
this outback is horrible .
extremely slow !
do n't go here unless you 've got _num_ hours to kill .
this is the absolute worst outback .
do not waste your time and money at this restaurant .
the print on the menu is tiny and the lights are dim .
it has cheese fries added to it .
what a shame !
i could 've said yellow for all she cared .
however , they were very shady at the end .
first off , a heads up .
however , i was n't overly impressed with the service .
this is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed .
the first time i went with a group of _num_ other friends .
the service was less than okay and food was mediocre , nothing really memorable .
went with a group of about _num_ - _num_ people on a thursday night .
the service was slow .
i think it was the worst mexican food i 've ever eaten .
even taco bell 's tacos were better tasting than this one .
the rice was dry and the salsa seemed to come right of the can .
i would not recommend uptown retreat .
i do n't like being lied to .
the real problem was the hair cut .
it was a disaster .
so my hair is lighter on the top and darker on the bottom .
my largest complaint is the cut it is awful !
he literally spent _num_ minutes cutting my hair if that .
i actually found this salon on yelp and am terribly disappointed .
i have never spent so much money to look this bad .
i can not recommend anyone doing business at uptown retreat salon .
i made a huge mistake .
but it makes me wan na go try caribou coffee .
not something i 'd regularly do .
the caribou associates know how to treat customers .
she offered no apology or solution .
this is the worst customer service i 've ever had at a starbucks .
wow , this thing is horrible .
they 're tasty and pretty cheap .
you 're better off buying a frozen pizza and cooking it your self .
another thing they need to drop are those chopped salads .
bottom line : _num_ for _num_ bucks !
still not worth it !
this version of dick 's does n't get me excited .
well there must have been a `` bank error `` they said .
i hate bank of america more than anything else in the world .
i made zero errors .
there was nothing left they could check .
i do n't get it .
i wish i had done the same .
but : concessions are a complete rip-off .
i usually know this , but jay talked me into it .
the restroom had no paper towels , and the trash cans were overflowing .
i feel like i 'm in the 80s at this movie theater .
i have n't been back here in years .
the food is mediocre at best .
the meat in both was slightly greasy and not particularly flavorful .
the rice was bland and slightly overcooked .
oh , and as for that `` cheap '' bit .
not the best mexican restaurant .
avoid if you can .
terrible .
the food is bland and boring .
do n't go here if you require food that has some kind of flavor .
the food is quite bland .
i ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese .
there was no seasoning , or none noticeable .
um ... no !
chips are obviously from bags .
salsa were runny and definitely not spicy .
the rice was bland .
overall , it was just disappointing !
i should have just eaten at qdoba which was nearby .
service was mediocre .
i used to like it alot .
terrible food , service always rushed .
i 've waited longer at taco bell , and had better tacos .
the food is greasy and tasteless .
tasted bland and watered down to me .
now , my street tacos on the other hand is a completely different story .
i could n't even eat them .
the items inside the taco were n't that great either .
there was lettuce and guac on the side .
the beans were beans , nothing special .
service is the reason why i will never give the food another chance .
i just do n't like being surprised when the ticket comes .
super long story short : sub-par food , worse service .
the food was pretty good , but service was pretty bad .
possibly the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
tacos were cold , soggy and tasted microwaved .
everything was severely overcooked and just plain bad in the ceviche .
my main course was n't much better .
this place has sadly become the worst mexican food place ever , for me .
my family visited the restaurant recently .
the manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional .
there was not even an attempt to right the wrong .
customer service was horrible .
the fajita chimichanga tasted like chinese food .
yet , he comes back with extra texas pete drenched on my wings .
she was n't helpful at all never asked how our food was .
it was so nasty my stomach hurt so bad afterwards .
i use to the this place but the management is horrible .
i go there often but my last three visit were terrible .
wasted time and time , no compensation .
found a manager to inform that we never received service or a bill .
no bill no nothing .
it 's sad that i have to leave one star !
so dissapointed ( as are neighbors of ours ) .
the quality of the food has gone way downhill as has the service .
the enchiladas were poorly made and for the most part tasteless .
we 're done with this poor excuse for a mexican restaurant .
delivered wrong pizza .
poor customer service .
being from louisiana , i 'm a huge smoothie king fan .
their general smoothie recipe is now _num_ % ice and _num_ % fruit juice .
it was $ _num_ after tax .
i wo n't give it just one star though .
there are some positives .
place is dirty .
will not go back .
do not waste your money !
it was just terrible .
the ice cream looked old , and after trying it , tasted like nothing .
it is also very expensive ( _num_ for a small ) .
above all , it was incredibly dirty in there !
both restrooms and the drinking fountain were out of order .
we will not be back .
ice cream is just ok imo and overpriced for the quality .
but this place deserves the _num_ stars .
there 's no health score posted and i believe that i know why .
maintenance takes weeks to fix things .
prices are n't great for what you 're getting .
would not recommend to a friend .
rip off apartment complex .
do not rent here .
i called the collection agency and they refuse to work with me .
the agency says that they do n't have that file either .
but we will not stand to be ripped off by you .
horrible place to live .
my air conditioning broke down a total of four times my stay here .
worst place to live !
they also run out of sweet tea a lot .
( the combo i usually get is _num_ cents less here . )
i was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl .
i really tried to like this place .
we tried the late night munchies deal and that was a disaster .
the only thing i liked from the box was the french fries .
worst italian food i have ever eaten .
no , thanks .
i could barely eat one .
it was dry and tasteless .
we also asked for extra ice and such , but our waitress never remembered .
when i was given my dish , it was a alfredo sauce .
i tried a little of the margherita pizza , and it was not good .
it was sooooo soggy on the bottom .
tried my coworkers penne vodka , and that was tasty !
terrible .
terrible terrible .
terrible terrible terrible .
food was bad .
bad idea .
the food 's presentation was awful .
i wish i could give it zero stars .
had the worst italian food ever ... ... .
pity as i like to support the local businesses .
marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet .
italian sausage was bland at best .
wine selection was average and overpriced .
would not recommend .
horrible dinner .
very bland and veal was tough pasta and veal had no salt .
this place sucked .
we were there with six people and the entire meal was a disaster .
they ca n't make an authentic antipasto .
they ca n't cook pasta .
the place just sucked .
obviously frozen product , blah .
big disappointment was received .
usually will give a place at least two times but not in this case .
same exact job but also including a new hose cost me $ _num_ .
i know chains tend to be more expensive but this price difference was unreal .
do n't waste your time coming here .
he never gave me the full total .
he gave me a more reasonable price .
i advise everyone to stay away from this scam company .
they took to long ... bad customer service .
they charge alot to have such bad customer service .
never go back there again .
i did n't like there attitude an customer service .
they are there for the money not to reply cater to the customer .
it does n't matter how hard i slam this place .
no one that works there can do anything about it .
how can i describe my experience here ?
their chips and salsa is bad .
the shrimp tasted like ... nothing .
even the cocktail sauce was bad .
do i deserve this ?
i mean ... shrimp from chilis ?
for the price , the food was awful .
truly awful .
the managers do n't care the server do n't care .
there were dirty plates and cups everywhere .
very gross .
suggest going elsewhere unless you have plenty of time to waste .
i really did n't care for the breakfast steak biscuits .
the meat patty was coated and then deep fried .
it was impossible to tell what type of meat it was .
it was like oil on oil .
the biscuit itself was ok .
but i would not go there for breakfast .
i 'm not entirely sure what the fuss about bojangles is .
quite frankly , i was a bit sad .
it was literally a piece of sadly breaded chicken on a sad biscuit .
1st it reeks of cigarettes .
the food selection is basically wings , burgers and pizza .
i 'll keep this one short - do not go here !
to me , that basically means that he has no idea what is wrong .
i 'm glad i did n't fill the prescription .
same practice same reason double the amount .
i do n't get it .
since then , the service level has always been horrible in this store .
food lion missed the boat big time with this decision .
i want to know what fool made this decision .
gross .
i would n't be surprised to see it close .
but this restaurant was not clean .
the floors had trash all over them .
there was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup .
i wo n't come back to this location .
service is poor especially for pick up orders .
never had a problem calling in orders at any other showmars .
i actually had to salt it because it was a little bland .
no ... .
there 's a $ _num_ ( ? )
deposit on the room that should be refunded in about a week .
but it 's not old , either .
terribly , terribly thin .
do not stay here .
false alarm .
the service manager is not an individual i feel that i can trust !
are you kidding me ?
worst part is my vehicle afterward still had a problem !
you do not pay hundreds of dollars for less than perfect service .
dealing with the service advisor at this dealership is useless .
also , think about buying the warranty on used cars .
avoid this place at all costs .
by all that is holy , do not stay here .
good thing my husband was there , because that was rough .
kind of a dingy version of the walgreen 's chain of drug stores .
finally , being open 24/7 is a plus at least .
i do n't know why i come here .
there is nothing to set this place apart from , ugh , walmart .
the worst walgreens in the history of walgreens .
very slow service with employees who seem to hate their jobs .
this walgreens is dreadful to go to .
_num_ hour later i came back and waited _num_ min again .
i switched drug stores immediately after this experience .
horrible customer service .
they move super slow and were n't helpful at all .
the old location would usually be moderately busy .
but not like it is now .
every time i visit this starbucks , it is completely slammed .
i can never find a seat and no one ever leaves .
they are usually friendly though .
i just dont know what it is .
if it was n't for that i would give another star .
i would not go back because i did n't feel welcomed at all .
my boyfriend and i booked a room on the executive floor for new years .
very lackluster .
recently renovated but my room was not completed and ac did not function properly .
no , he would n't have .
this is not the place to stay for a weekend get away .
i complained to our banquet captain at least _num_ times about the noise level .
and they still seem to give our guest the wrong food .
i am extremely disappointed with the way things went at our event !
ok , i just ate a science project .
check-in at the hilton university place was a breeze .
unfortunately , that is about where the good ended .
that would be an elevator that took about _num_ minutes to arrive .
the restaurant was completely empty .
after almost _num_ minutes , the food arrived .
i sent back the flatbread .
she was more than gracious and apologetic .
we paid and left , completely unsatisfied with the meal .
_num_ minutes later , she arrived .
in summary , i would expect so much more from a hilton property .
this level of noise makes sleep difficult .
this is obviously not a child friendly establishment and we were not welcome there .
as for the food , it was just okay .
the bagels were chewy and my son could hardly tear his with his teeth .
never insult someone 's children .
i walked into the store looking for yellow flowers .
i saw _num_ women chatting in the work area and another near the counter .
not one of them acknowledged my presence for at least _num_ minutes .
very short and not paying attention to me .
i am appalled by the lack of customer service and rude interaction i received .
called trying to get info to put together some arrangements .
only then are you informed how long the wait will be .
obviously this is insane .
slow .
not much else to say .
they also keep soap in a locked display .
this is a sketchy location and i do n't feel safe here .
especially how long you have to wait in this questionable environment .
this makes no sense .
always slow .
wo n't even let you float on your back .
there are better and worse y 's for sure .
the only thing i ever have to wait on are the free weights .
its close , so this is where i go .
my family of _num_ is staying here while our house is being worked on .
so far i have witnessed _num_ drug deals in the parking lot .
will not stay here again !
i love hampton hotels more than anything but this was a terrible experience .
surly staff that was never at the desk .
thank goodness i was staying on the first floor with my disabled mother .
run away from this property as quickly as possible !
made a reservation in june for july .
the clerk made and error and made the reservations for june .
we went to a wedding only to find the hotel had no room .
they did nothing for us , not even an apology .
this property has gotten very tired .
the place was not even that busy .
but the service was bad .
bad service gets the same .
at the same time , this chain is past its prime .
sorry , but this site may disappoint .
this place is horrible and has crappy service .
they might have to teach their cooks how to cook a steak .
not a good sign if you ca n't cook steaks at the right temperature .
yep , that loud .
this was quite honestly my worst experience ever at a tgi fridays .
this time , it went bad .
the chicken was soggy , and tasteless .
it was a disaster on date night , and very disappointing .
i did n't think it was going to be as bad as i experienced .
five people could n't see an opened table clearly behind them ?
i feel that i probably wo n't be going back to this location again .
the only reason i went here was for a book club meeting .
i 've been here several times and the food is very sub-par .
did n't much like the steak , and the fries were terrible .
the service was slow .
then i ate there and was reminded .
they were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry .
eating there made me realize why i never actually go eat there .
poor service !
when i called him out , he proceeded to get loud and walked away !
i am calling the gm !
the worst i have had on the road .
had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at tgi fridays on harris blvd .
service was questionable .
steak overdone , rice dry and overdone , poor service .
very disappointing birthday dinner for my son .
this place sucks so hard .
have n't seen this much worse service in an american restaurant .
tonight was horrible !
we were seated immediately , however our server was not a good one .
he then brought the checks and did n't add the cakes in .
i did n't put it in .
it tasted and smelled like fish .
it looked like it was under cooked .
i ordered the chicken sandwich which tasted much better .
the bun came out soggy and the sandwich did not hold very well together .
it was not good .
he was unapologetic , rude and a condescending .
zero stars for me .
they literally messed up on every single person at the tables order .
the visit i made on my birthday jan _num_ , was the absolute worst .
this after they brought her the absolute wrong order .
then it was loud , due to people , and the bartenders .
horrible service .
horrible horrible horrible .
it took _num_ minutes to get drinks !
not even a glass of water .
horrible .
i really think our waitress forgot to put our order in .
the service here sucks .
the place was out of control .
not a sign of management .
this place needs a severe cleaning job from top to bottom .
tables were n't clean .
the gentlemen at the front in the host position were terribly unprofessional .
i got an apple martini and it did not taste like apple at all .
i will not be back ever !
if you 're white , do n't bother .
service is extremely slow .
endless apps were over _num_ mins apart from the kitchen .
poor quality service and professionalism across the board .
i consider myself a very patient person however , this was completely ridiculous .
they need a complete overhaul of management and employees .
worst service i have ever experienced .
server was simply lousy .
with all the other poor reviews why has this place not improved ?
sanitation grade _num_ .
do n't recommend .
my husband & i , went here for lunch .
the menu was alot different than the last time we was at applebees . ]
we was disappointed of the food and service .
bad service & terrible food , do n't recommend .
the food is really bad .
i should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing .
despite the good food the customer service has turned me away from this restaurant .
very bad service .
also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here .
also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked .
customer service has been awful and i would not return .
she barely came to the table to check on us .
she never once refilled our waters .
it was a crowded mess .
he said , `` thanks for the feedback , '' then he left .
the food itself was eh .
it was bad .
we ordered two caesar salads , and she brought two house salads .
place was n't busy at all .
if you are looking for a quick lunch do n't go here .
this literally is the worst restaurant i 've been to my entire life .
wrong .
waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes .
not very customer service oriented .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
i highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant .
if i could give this particular applebee 's _num_ stars i would .
we 've been there several times and each time we left disappointed .
no biggie because it happens from time to time .
she was totally inept .
she could n't even get our drink order right .
i pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back .
it must have been _num_ - _num_ minutes before it came .
she never even gave us silverware or napkins .
we managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins .
she went to go get them and never returned .
we finished the meal , paid , and left without tipping .
no one goes to applebees because they want outstanding food .
walked into the smallest waiting area i 've ever seen in a sit-down establishment .
_num_ couples ahead of me and my wife ... wait time is 10-15 minutes .
_num_ minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated .
needless to say , we walked out .
this place has permanently lost my patronage .
first off the management here sucks ass !
the server did all that she could but damn !
worst service i have ever had .
when we said something there was one excuse after another !
it 's soup and a wedge salad .
no bacon and barely any toppings .
i knew my one experience wednesday night was too good to be true .
we still stayed because i insisted on applebee 's .
do n't waste your time .
some overpriced crackers , nuts , or pretzels .
i 'm not coming back until she 's either quit or fired !
they were very rude about it .
some of the worst customer service we 've ever encountered .
verizon is going to lose customers for this .
do not go to this location .
terrible `` hostess '' experience .
woman at the front had a terrible attitude as soon as i walked on .
i 'm continued to be so disappointed by the `` hostess '' .
they really act like you 're an inconvenience .
really disappointed .
terrible service , lead by tim .
ca n't you pay someone to update that crap ?
awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are _num_ years old .
disappointing .
my name was the next one not marked off .
i wo n't be back .
big mistake coming here .
will never return , even if my hair does grow back .
nancy was very unprofessional and rude .
i got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich .
it was a really bad experience .
i am not sure how appropriate is to talk to a customer like this .
avoid !
terrible wait times at night .
staff appears confused regularly .
i gave this location multiple chances .
avoid !
if you stand near the soda fountain area it will smell like sewage .
i had to get up and find my waitress myself .
on top of that the food was very salty and greasy .
i had _num_ pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold .
one pancake i couldnt actually bite into .
i would not come back .
i am glad our meeting is changing either way i will not be returning .
this place is the worst !
the orange juice did n't taste like real juice .
wrong !
the food was old and somewhat cold .
we ordered burgers and it was awful .
have n't gone back since .
our first mistake was that we came too close to closing time .
the manager jackie was extremely rude !
they even gave me a hard time about making a new order .
worst customer service ever !
horrible .
the food was flavorless and the chicken was n't cooked all the way .
there were n't many choices at the bar .
to make matters worse , i got sick later that night from the food .
do n't do it because they give you the worst rooms .
i 'm allergic to smoke .
no refund .
never going back to a sleep inn again .
so we decide to go last evening and man were we disappointed .
the most disappointing aspect of our visit was the smoked beef brisket .
there was so much fat , and it was fairly tough .
having read the reviews , i knew to stay away from the brisket .
i went with a `` lunch '' sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast .
it was dry and not much more than warm .
no , i do n't think so .
and it was n't even tender !
am i asking for too much ?
food was not good .
service was not good .
do n't waste a meal here .
he started off by saying `` just _num_ '' .
as though _num_ people was not enough .
horrible .
really horrible .
their screen setup could be awesome , except they are n't hd .
do n't waste your time !
the local coworkers were n't fans of it either .
_num_ people ordered wine , and the first _num_ got it in wine glasses .
no bueno .
i didnt taste any alcohol .
not consistent .
i ordered the _num_ item platter , as i wanted a taste of everything .
the sausage was disgusting , and not spicy at all .
lastly , their bathroom reeks of urine .
let me say , this place is not somewhere to eat .
it 's a drinking place .
wrong .
this was a bad experience from the start .
the salad was good , the ribs were as tough as leather .
the service was horrible .
then _num_ out of _num_ of us had incorrect orders .
all of our baked potatoes were hard and cold .
it was a mess .
dismissive associates ... .
needless to say i got no rest .
the sheets also had holes in them .
least professional staff i have ever seen .
on morning one of my visit i accidentally broke the waffle batter machine .
apparently maintenance took lunch and never came back .
rant over .
calling corporate offices to complain about this place ... its beyond unacceptable .
soooo , needless to say , no waffles for me .
this is was far from a hot breakfast if you ask me .
not good .
the common areas ( lobby , breakfast area , hallway ) were nice .
once i got to the room , i was disappointed .
there was a smell as soon as i walked in the room .
the toilet stopped up and i called the front desk .
if my company had n't prepaid for the stay , i would have left .
the front desk staff were very courteous and the coffee and breakfast was acceptable .
it was n't the best but it was n't the worst .
only deserving of _num_ stars .
everything about this place screams a budget hotel , except for the price .
otherwise , do n't be fooled .
the furniture is worn and dirty .
the room smelled like an ash tray .
this has happened the last _num_ out of _num_ times i visited this location .
all honesty , you are better off going somewhere else or a different location .
i will not be bringing it back any time soon .
i ended up getting the parts off line and had them installed elsewhere .
anything more than an oil change , i would n't trust them .
i can not trust them .
i do not recommend .
horrible place , the lobby is dirty and the workers are rude .
this hotel has the worst customer service that i have ever seen .
they were rude and the room was n't clean .
this place is a nightmare .
the price is appealing but not worth it .
the room i was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window .
i asked for a refund and left immediately .
if i could give it _num_ i would .
more midnight traffic than a _num_ hour dennys .
the bed was very uncomfortable !
the entire place was just filthy !
oh , and the free breakfast was nothing more than dry cereal and juice .
the milk pitcher was never once refilled .
i will never return to this dump ever again !
it had fallen on the floor .
it made me worry what smell they were trying to cover up .
but , for the extremely low price ... what did i expect .
i would n't go back , that 's for sure .
for last minute we had the one queen bed room and it was awful .
the carpet was dirty and the room was extremely dusty .
very outdated on the inside .
shower was covered in soap scum .
gross !
spend a few dollars more and stay away .
something must have happened because i was very disappointed last night .
the boneless short ribs was a bad , bad choice for the appetizer .
and sushi is sushi is sushi if they are rolled correctly .
however , the service was not up to par today .
i know that the economy has been hard on everyone , but whoa .
now , i 'm going to update my review from my _num_ review .
menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes .
so , this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out .
so , lets get back to the menu .
steam rice on the other hand is free ( which i picked ) .
fried rice : eggs , sesame seed , and soy sauce .
no green onions , carrots , and all that other good stuff .
bland .
and mind , i ate two of my party 's portion on noodles .
the tempura , i had no taste for it .
the batter had no taste , as well as the sauce .
that 's not it !
however , the salmon was not good .
it fell apart and had bones in it .
i first ordered salmon sashimi and then got salmon nigiri instead .
overall , i was not impressed with the food but liked the people .
the miso soup was hot but the taste only average .
the service was bad as well !
it was absolutely too much .
there is not much of a raw roll selection .
i am used to more creativity in rolls and this place was lacking .
one of the pieces i received was totally different from what i ordered .
we would not go again , having experienced far better .
sorry i wo n't recommend .
oh , no !
the food does n't have any flavor .
the sushi guy has major attitude .
the sushi is not worth your time .
it had carrots in it .
then they brought out my fried rice .
it was n't the display chef 's fault !
another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food .
i immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi `` chef '' was .
what struck me so quickly was how thin the sashimi was cut !
when i mean thin , i mean thin enough to see through the slice !
i was offended .
this `` chef '' is blatantly trying to rip people off .
not here .
while the atmosphere was nice , i did not enjoy the food .
it was probably the least delicious hibachi i have ever been to .
i would not recommend this hibachi .
our chef was lacking any kind of personality or energy .
maybe i came on a bad night ?
i begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm .
the milk shake was taking long so i begin eating my room temp nuggets .
nasty , hate this place .
do n't understand why people are obsessed with nasty fried chicken .
busy is not an excuse for under cooked food .
i canceled my membership and they lost a customer for life .
way to keep business drew .
the vending machine for free samples was broken the last two times i went .
my last visit they ran out of shopping carts .
i am not kidding - this is no joke .
when i walked up everyone was busy with customers .
it was actually painfully slow .
unfortunately , one of these items required a return for an even exchange .
i quickly advised the associate this was totally unacceptable and bring a manager immediately .
i again insisted on speaking to a member of management .
another associate handled the actual exchange transaction .
more business than they wish to handle .
it certainly was not me .
worst place ever !
very rude .
the return policy is horrible !
stay away from sales person kevin .
ordered online , waited a month for delivery date .
day comes and they miss the _num_ hour delivery window .
they call me and extend the window .
then they do n't show up until _num_ hours later !
no one called , no apologies .
asked if they would guarantee it would be here this time ?
just the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
staff is extremely rude and unprofessional .
the company never responded to my questions in the store or online .
worse experience ever .
worst delivery experience ever .
i called customer service and they were zero help .
terrible experience !
do not do business with this company .
i have experienced poor customer service and shady salespeople .
it 's difficult to do business with a company that you do not trust .
they never were opened and nothing was applied to the furniture .
do not buy this couch !
total waste of _num_ $ !
they will be extremely rude and give you the run around .
i have never been so disrespected from a customer service rep .
also products are crappy also .
in fact , just about everything here tasted like something else .
so my money is on the lotus buffet .
the first time was so-so , the second time was better .
( gross out side note : their bathrooms need better ventilation .
literally the worst chinese buffet i have ever been to .
sushi was mushy .
vegetables limp and overlooked .
all sauces were too sweet and most tasted the same .
it was n't even warm .
i have no idea how this has n't failed a health inspection .
not the worst chinese i 've had , but definitely not the best .
good for a cheap lunch , but very americanized selection .
greasy unappetizing fried food .
low quality ingredients .
decent food if you 're not a chinese food enthusiast .
low quality food but the $ _num_ lunch special makes it worth it .
horrible service .
had the $ _num_ lunch and it was exactly what i expected .
not a great selection of food .
last week i stopped by to get the battery of my watch changed .
are you kidding me ?
it pains me to write this review .
$ _num_ and $ _num_ is not consistent !
he was just trying to rip me off again .
i was recently at this store to make an expensive jewelry purchase .
not a fan !
there is no sense of customer service at this store .
the dental hygienist was very rude .
never before have i encountered such unprofessional service at a doctor 's office .
i will not be going back to this doctor .
wow , what a bad experience .
she , with no hesitation , denied me any medication for the pain .
i was suffering and she had zero compassion for me .
i paid my bill and left and refused to make another appointment .
i do not recommend this dentist .
she 's a rip off !
disgusting !
unbelievable .
it 's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks .
but for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot !
terrible .
ugly dcor , bad food , poor service .
the service is terrible !
i did n't get one smile from either bartender .
when it came out it was missing cheese and had _num_ onion slice .
i will not go again .
well since no one would wait on us , we left .
smells terrible weird mixture of nail polish and sour beer .
nasty .
and the food was bad .
all the pasta for our party was undercooked ; there were _num_ of us .
other customers also were returning meals .
all _num_ entrees ( big family ) ordered were served cold .
not warm , not luke warm , cold !
i had two items : a caesar salad , and a margherita pizza .
the cheese was ok , the tomatoes were flavorless .
it was covered with chopped green herbs .
i had n't been to a macaroni grill in a number of years .
i most likely wo n't be back to one for a very long time .
my wife got mama 's trio .
she did n't really care for any of it .
the worst macaroni grill i 've ever been to !
do not waste your time !
another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ( $ _num_ ) .
this was a disappointment .
another of us ordered the chicken parm ( $ _num_ ) .
nothing special there .
their close proximity does n't win out over quality .
hello new owners ; this is a recipe for disaster .
`` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
do they have a corporate taste kitchen ?
it was a bucket of dry pasta with some cheese and meat .
a poached egg on top ?
not the way to do it .
besides , the egg pasta was too thick .
do not waste your money .
i had an italian mojito which i do n't recommend , period ... blech .
i would n't get it again .
worst dining experience ever .
_num_ minutes in , he finally gets our drink orders .
_num_ minutes in , finally takes our damn order .
first one , no dressing .
when my food finally came , it was all lacking in flavor .
i did n't see my bill , and was told everything was taken off .
overall , i would never dine here again .
we were visiting friends in charlotte and chose macaroni grill to meet .
the restaurant was practically empty on a sunday afternoon when we met .
everything else ( except the friends ) was disappointing .
this was a work lunch so i had to attend .
hostess greeted the group quickly and was ready to seat us .
not a great presentation of the dining area .
tough , clearly overcooked , and just downright horrible .
will not be visiting again .
the brick chicken did n't taste fresh .
it was like a fast food chicken with that really dried out taste .
anyway , i totally can not remember what i ate here.
terrible service .
thought the staff was incredibly rude .
after we were seated and ordered our food did not all come out together .
the food sucked !
even the salads were watery and bland .
so i picked this place to change his mind .
_num_ minutes later our order gets put in .
_num_ minutes later our appetizer comes out .
i guess she figured we were new and did n't know any better .
okay so the app was meh , main entrees yay !
he ordered a pork dish and i had lobster ravioli .
and it tasted so microwaved .
soup was served cold with basil leaves which were dry .
pasta was ok but too greasy .
please avoid this restaurant !
it is not worth the time or money .
but it was like that through the whole entire meal .
one thing is a mistake , multiple things being out is bad management somewhere .
i am sorry i ca n't give less than _num_ star .
i sat there for _num_ minutes with my family and was ignored .
will never step foot at this place again .
our order was lost from the waitress to the kitchen .
our drink order was also forgotten .
there were _num_ of us so maybe a smaller group may have better luck .
the food was fine , but our service was atrocious .
do n't bother with this place .
first , our waitress went missing a few times .
the manager brought out our food but never apologized .
she was very apologetic .
our other sandwiches were just as disappointing .
just another chain food restaurant .
i long for a real deli in charlotte !
food was meh , nothing special .
tables were all dirty and the drink station was sticky and not very sanitary .
slow service .
this is the second time this has happened in less than a month .
so i made sure the door was locked .
this is an email i received from what seems to be the manager .
very rude .
the room and bed was fine and the hotel did not look run down .
we only stayed one night and went back home .
do not trust this days in .
no refund given .
rude and unprofessional .
you do n't get to see the room .
all i got was a smoking room .
went back and changed and got another smokers room .
out of site till they show you no refund after _num_ mins .
do not trust this days in .
they stole my money .
the room is not worth _num_ bucks .
it 's not worth _num_ bucks .
do n't waste your time or money .
i lost money .
so do n't take my word .
why would they say _num_ mins lose refund .
it 's that bad !
unprofessional when owner says go to hell to a customer asking for refund !
also note they lie when you fight it with your bank .
same price by the airport and your in a luxury .
do n't trust this pace .
unfair _num_ mins refund before you even see a room .
rooms are disgusting .
that 's why they hide the _num_ mins warning out of plan site .
so do n't trust this place and if you want bed bugs .
sheets looked old .
same price and so much better .
room was n't completely clean either .
found food and trash in the refrigerator .
the breakfast was weak .
never going back .
the bathroom was gross , no words other than that can describe it .
it was a pretty bad experience .
i did n't leave a tip for probably the second time in my life .
expansive menu from italian to greek , even mexican !
portion large enough for _num_ meals .
this time especially , my room did n't seem as clean as it should .
you better off staying in a roach motel .
there was no hot water for _num_ days .
cleaning of the room is suppose to be on tuesday .
my room was n't clean when we got back to the hotel .
i would not stay here again .
exercise equipment and some of the dryers and washing machine were broken .
do not waste your money here .
they are also not very flexible .
however , besides that one situation , they typically seem to care .
they 're also very expensive .
however , you have no set vet there , as far as i know .
small dogs may be different .
there is no reason that they should n't have caught that he was dying .
$ _num_ for antibiotics that you can buy at harris teeter for $ _num_ .
without mentioning money once , i was told all that they would do .
i have no need to do that .
did get groom or however they did not give the shot yet .
way too long , for something so simple .
very unpleasant experience with this animal hospital .
took my puppy there for the first time this week .
horrible !
i will not be going back !
well , they noticed he has a couple loose teeth and dirty ears .
needless to say , i am very disappointed .
i was wrong .
they do n't seem to care too much .
i am so stressed out and very worried .
the rest of us gave up and left .
i give this place zero stars .
i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone , even my worst enemy .
i am extremely disappointed .
i have been going here since november and today was horrible .
i left with _num_ finger bleeding , _num_ nails on crooked and skimpy polish .
very disappointed in this place .
would not recommend !
slow service ... took almost two hours to deliver on two separate occasions .
the food was cold both times .
way too much money for the wrong stuff !
ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold .
wing sauce was spilled all over bag .
this additional charge should have been mentioned on the menu .
they deserve zero stars .
confusion on the phone over what they did or did n't have available .
stay away !
nothing special .
big mistake because he did n't check the food .
the tenders had no seasoning on them .
there was nothing to dip my celery in .
very comparable to have an entree and _num_ sides .
i 'm so glad we split it .
it was so loud , i jumped out of my seat haha .
my water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled .
however , they brought out one salad and one meal .
like no extra dishes , no splitting anything , etc .
however , afterwards , both of us mentioned it to each other .
wait staff did not come to ask if our steaks were cooked correctly .
worst experience i have had in a longhorn in _num_ years .
would n't recommend it at all .
not going back .
i made an order over the phone for a _num_ oz .
steak for _num_ and was told _num_ to _num_ minutes for pickup .
went to the restaurant at the time i hung up the phone .
i finally got my refund and left the restaurant not happy at all .
i never once got a refill , even when i asked .
she got my order wrong not once , but twice .
the food was just mediocre .
my potato came out very soggy , the steak very much over cooked .
lastly , when she took our check , the waitress yet again disappeared .
never once have i been told the tip amounts at a restaurant .
i would n't recommend eating here , and i certainly wo n't be returning .
i attempted to order an ultimate steakhouse martini with kettle one .
the bartender was the worst experience of the night .
extremely inattentive , uninterested and not warm .
i 'm not an idiot , i can see that .
i was immediately disgusted .
i assume she was the general manager .
when she returned it was only a bill for the martini .
i am utterly surprised they did not compensate my entire meal .
it was flavorless and i had to add a ton of salt .
my server was nice , but not friendly at all .
the salad was very bland and did n't have much dressing .
the bread seemed really dried out and flavorless as well .
oh and drinks for lunch are very expensive !
$ _num_ for a lemonade !
my father was in this facility for a short time ( _num_ days ) .
i can not recommend this facility .
do not go to this car wash .
this location was no different .
buy their upgrades and it is a waste .
i 'm not that impressed .
for $ _num_ , i could do a better job in my garage .
i wo n't be back .
half ass job for more money than i 'm used to spending .
terrible job !
will not go back .
inspection slow and unprofessional .
left my car dirty and smelling of cigarettes .
i usually do n't ask for a receipt unless i donate electronics and such .
i wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back .
it was one of the most frustrating calls ive made in a long time .
very disappointed !
however , their employees and even the manager could n't be efficient about this .
even the manager could n't be any sincere about what had happened .
by the time we ordered , there were _num_ other people behind us .
one time i saw an old lady take a taxi through the drive thru .
i get alright service sometimes , then terrible at other times .
ordered _num_ gallon of sweet tea .
very disappointed .
the most ghetto ran wendy 's i have ever been to .
the staff is ghetto and rude and the food was horrible .
it was cold and old food .
ghetto staff means lack of caring !
never had a problem at this one until today .
yeah i paid _num_ dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich .
not something you just feel like free styling .
i 've been craving breadsticks since i picked up some from target .
i could n't eat it after the first piece .
bland $ _num_ of waste !
on average probably twice a month .
several times they 've screwed my order up , often leaving ingredients off completely .
so tonight i called my order in ( i usually do it online ) .
but hey , that 's just me .
anyway , that 's not even why i 'm upset .
his reply was that he did n't see it .
i reply that i assure him that i 'm not lying about it .
delivery even on busy nights like saturday is faster than the others .
it 's the execution that lacks .
luckily i do n't mind coke ... .
i really have no idea what it is .
the dining room always looks closed .
i really did n't know what i was supposed to expect .
i wo n't be going back .
then , i went again and it was a different story .
like a cup of water mixed condiments was poured on the burger .
at this point i was angry .
if you want a surprise burger , go to this bk .
if you want extra extra slow service , go to this burger king .
pulled off to the same freaking messed up order !
the sesame chicken was just okay , as was the general and orange chicken .
chicken was way over cooked .
terrible !
tried this place because i was referred by a friend .
i really wish i could rate the complex individually .
however , the worst part about this complex is the front office .
unfortunately , can not say the same about the front office women .
they are incompetent with their jobs .
they can not answer simple billing questions , or requests .
stop apologizing and fix the problem !
shape was uneven and no attention to details whatsoever .
*** this place is horrible !
bland .
gross .
terrible .
not a chance .
as i left i suggested the manager change this policy .
my first try was with the meatballs and pasta .
standard italian food - nothing i could buy at the grocery store .
my spaghetti was watery and had barely enough sauce to coat the watery noodles .
no frills .
issue # _num_ : i ordered the chicken parm sub with fries .
the sandwich itself was mediocre .
not my ideal chicken parm !
it was fine to eat i guess , just not a chicken parm .
no problem , they included tax .
umm , why the double tax ?
if not for the nice waitress , would have been _num_ star .
this place is gross .
the food is gross , along with the decor & especially the carpet .
very old and very run down .
staff friendly and all but the place looks dirty .
these people rip you off !
she looked at my shirts .
the other woman tell me i owe _num_ dollars a pair !
go elsewhere trying to save you from a nightmare at the dry cleaners !
had a _num_ month old shirt cleaned here .
said they fixed the hole to `` help me out '' no !
just got a shirt destroyed there .
no offer of apology or credit .
please do not let the star rating for this groomer fool you .
it 's not a good establishment and certainly did n't meet my standards .
hardly worthy of mention here a decade later .
service was weak .
food was not good on three occasions .
my children ordered chicken nuggets , they were burnt .
service was slow .
will not be back despite the `` big '' discount .
no stars would be correct .
this place wo n't be around for too much longer i 'm sure .
_num_ stars .
went for dinner , service was terrible , food was worse .
very disappointing .
salmon was so dry it was difficult to cut much less eat .
not happening again .
too many good restaurants in charlotte to waste time and money here .
she said she would get it changed .
almost immediately she came back and said her manager refused to change our bill .
could n't even finish it , which says a lot for friday happy hour .
it 's sad that the food is so bad .
unfortunately , that 's not enough to bring us back .
there are _num_ restaurants within walking distance of our apartment .
i would rate a _num_ .
bottom line is , do n't do it .
i told him `` just remember , it 's not their fault they suck .
just does n't cut it .
advertised as italian , olive garden should be offended .
did not stick around to argue .
do n't waste your money .
gross !
i did n't eat it .
that 's $ _num_ for _num_ drinks .
the boyfriend lives down the street and we went for breakfast today .
the service was terrible .
ugh .
the food is barely passable .
did n't like it !
sorry but you guys deserve a _num_ .
big mistake .
service was slow and the restaurant was not crowded .
the server kept forgetting to bring requested items , mixed everyone 's orders up .
ordered the lasagna and got mush instead .
it was a pile of cheese in a sea of grease .
wo n't be visiting there again .
our waitress was very friendly but slow .
food is over priced and not very good .
all _num_ in our party was n't pleased with the food .
drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go !
the private room we were in was nice but cold .
it was overcooked and turned gray .
they were cut too thin and therefore hard to control the cooking temperature .
as a result they came out overcooked .
they , again , were not cooked to medium ... overcooked to medium well .
they were not seasoned well .
a good steak never requires steak sauce .
_num_ ) the private room was great but never warmed up .
_num_ ) the server was as good as you could ever ask for .
_num_ ) the food was lackluster .
and the breakfast is n't very good at all .
i 'm just not impressed with their breakfast .
my real issue is with the eggs they served me .
they were burnt and cooked down to nothing .
honestly it looked like one scrambled egg to me .
the salmon was way over seasoned , over cooked and had a suspicious smell .
since it is so close i will probably return for drinks but not food .
servers are awesome , the food is a hole in a wall quality .
rip off .
not happening again , because i 'm never going back again .
no `` thank you '' or `` have a good day '' .
i can not tell you how mad this company makes me .
the next thing i know , i am in collection for $ _num_ .
i mean , this could cost me for a long time .
so here is the kicker that makes me even more mad .
however , here is how they contacted me .
then i wait for someone to come on the line .
absolutely terrible service to have a phone system like this .
just poor service .
it 's not worth it .
poor results and questionable billing .
requested a meeting and no one showed up .
they will not communicate with a simple phone call .
the produce was n't always kept up well either .
the only thing harris teeter has to offer is a better coupon policy .
big disappointment .
i left _num_ minutes after arrival .
ordered cashew chicken , hot and spicy beef and kung pao chicken .
never ever will i order from here again .
ridiculous .
terrible .
simply terrible .
i have one shoe which the sole is falling off .
what 's worse , i found a scratch on the side later .
this place is overrated .
the food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown .
you also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit .
at that point it goes from mildly amusing to uncomfortable and rude .
no big deal for my me or my wallet .
but it left a bad taste in my mouth .
not a word in _num_ months .
i 've walked in to make purchases .
i 'm usually met with `` next register .
no one seems to care .
none offered .
this is really frustrating .
the contacts have small print and does not allow you to cancel your service .
terrible customer service .
and she was doing me a favor and hung up on me !
unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that .
this company 's contract is very frustrating to work with .
overpriced and my muffin was stale .
not worth the $ _num_ i spent on the muffin and coffee .
will not go again .
not good !
really , not good .
i was so disappointed .
strange looking , and bad tasting .
not good at all .
so that was a strange start .
i would n't stay there again for what it cost .
please do not see this vet .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
this place is terrible .
probably the rudest receptionist and office staff we have ever encountered .
i walked in and was told it was a 30-40 minute wait .
at that time , one of the hair stylist went out back .
of course after having a smoke break , she reeked of smoke .
i could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card .
zero stars .
so she is choosing one paying customer over another .
was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly .
i payed $ _num_ for a large cheese pizza .
the pizza was nice and hot , but was mediocre in taste .
not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight .
the pizza now is just ok .
i have had a meatball sub and stuffed shells and they are both ok .
unfortunately , i was let down .
i was told _num_ min .
well _num_ turned into _num_ .
but it 's not great .
i went here originally because there was no monthly contract , _num_ a month .
he put me in the first room , next to the front desk .
too bad .
it took _num_ hours and our pizza was cold .
i sucked it up and ate _num_ pieces of pizza and _num_ wings .
the pizza was flavorless and the crust tasted like cardboard .
needless to say , i will never go back to papa john 's again .
no way are they that busy that early in the mornings .
ridiculous .
if i could give this place a negative _num_ , i would .
it looked like microwaved pizza and it tasted terrible , cardboard like .
i do n't get how they use better ingredients and it tastes terrible .
the worst thing about coming to fort mill is this mcdonald 's .
the service is awful .
you might ask `` how do you mess up a cup of coffee ? ''
that 's not how i ordered it .
dirty and nasty .
the parking lot is a bit weird to access .
i did n't check the bathrooms .
this particular store sets the bar to a new low .
i will never be back .
employees are unbelievably rude most of the time .
on the bed , there are a couple of dead roaches .
however , the doors are closed and locked shut .
the spot we stayed in was quite long , and very level .
no frills , but not expensive either .
thank goodness we did n't have to use the bathrooms , beyond sketchy !
not at all impressed .
no security whatsoever !
no gates .
yes bar - no one under _num_ allowed .
really only space for our 5th wheel .
not long enough or wide enough for your vehicle too .
still not level and only enough room for camper and _num_ vehicle .
has a nice pool snack shack - but this was not opened .
from that point on , our experience was unbelievably bad .
_num_ minutes later , they appeared .
it took just over _num_ minutes for the food to arrive .
they were all crisp , no potato , and no flavor .
my wife 's veggie sandwich was very plain .
i honestly can not see giving this establishment a rating higher than a _num_ .
i said attempt because they did n't have much to offer .
i pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance .
the reply was the owners wo n't let us buy anything .
_num_ ) ok everyone can have a bad day so we returned this sunday .
once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week .
wrong .
there is much more that i can say but this is already a novel .
long story short .
the food sucks and we will not return .
the service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible .
ridiculous .
it so deserves less than minus !
he refused to give me anything but the store number !
and this office have very bad customer service nobody say hey nobody help .
i feel like they hate any one to go in their office .
less than zero .
these people do not return your calls and they dont want to help you .
first , the area is sketchy at best .
the hotel is very noisy because the walls are paper thin .
( _num_ ) free breakfast but there is no mixing it up ... ... .
( _num_ ) size of the bathroom .
( _num_ ) cleanliness .
( _num_ ) lack of amenities .
the pool was empty ( no water ) mid may .
so glad i did n't send the kids on ahead to the pool .
no one bothered to tell us that the pool was out of commission .
anyone could just walk right up to that empty pool and fall in .
however , it is in the process of being renovated .
in its current state , i would not recommend it .
i did n't see many family during our stay !
waited _num_ minutes for them to check me into someone else 's room .
_num_ more minutes and finally someone came up front .
they checked me into someone else 's room .
this new room stinks of cigarette smoke , it 's filthy inside .
avoid this place at all costs .
still the general manager has not returned a phone call or a text message .
still no contact from the general manager !
the room was clean and the air was cold .
i would def look elsewhere before i booked here .
not the best i have had mediocre and generic for that matter .
not good kinda left feeling sick .
the only plus to this place was the super sized sodas .
nothing about the visit stands out to me .
i probably would not go back .
just a poor , poor experience at this location overall .
luckily for me , i live in rock hill .
secondly , there were ants everywhere !
the room was very small and was not worth the amount we paid .
plus , no free wifi !
this is by far the worst motel _num_ i 've ever stayed in .
eggplant parm was salty .
veal parm was tough and so thin .
the breading was thicker than the veal .
will probably not go back except perhaps to try the pizza .
very forgettable .
it did n't help that the ac was n't working while we ate .
i would not recommend at all .
i will not return , terrible customer service .
she understood but it was the owners call .
and the pizza was n't good .
it had too much cheese and hardly any sauce and it was burnt .
went for the lunch buffet and was very disappointed .
that evening our meal at a family restaurant took _num_ hours .
i was shocked to see that they were using fake frozen meatballs .
it 's a shame .
he was n't rude , i think just not up on server etiquette .
we may try this place again , maybe for the lunch buffet .
i have had better and i have had worse .
the guacamole is always bland .
our waiter greeted us nearly as soon as we walked through the door .
the salsa , although bland , was surprisingly spicy .
becky noticed it too .
not much in the way of flavor though .
becky ordered some meat with chile sauce which came first .
none of the food was anything to write home about .
only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order .
chili verde was ok but not worth $ _num_ .
husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland .
i asked for a refund and she said how much was it ?
she finally got the receipt and gave me $ _num_ cash back .
i will never go back into this establishment again .
it 's awful .
been here several times and well , shame on me .
rude customer service in beer section .
called me a liar when i said the beer was stale .
it was an expensive craft beer .
they need to check their dates and stop selling stale , overpriced beer !
the vendor did n't stock your shelves , fool !
just want people to understand truth in advertising .
would not suggest this place to anyone .
especially do not go here if you are a craft beer drinker .
for a destination dinner , i think not .
it 's just not enough to keep us coming anymore .
this place has went downhill bad .
the food is pretty mediocre .
the steak was cooked right but just did n't have much flavor .
after dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks .
it is only for people sitting at the bar .
not good for food .
cost us _num_ bucks for _num_ orders of ribs with one side and soda .
the food was terrible .
my husband and i came here for lunch on a thursday .
the wait staff was helpful and service was quick .
tea was very weak and the glasses were very small .
appetizer , hot wings , were mediocre at best .
not hot and sorta greasy .
wife got salad , which was unimpressive and a little wilted .
it appeared to be pan fried , as is was greasy .
it was a very poor cut of meat , with much fat and gristle .
you pay for a choice cut of meat and get waffle house food .
i went to this place probably _num_ years ago .
was not impressed then .
has gotten worse .
we all went home after and did n't feel like doing anything after this .
the inside smells horrible ... like old and soggy and dusty .
i ordered a salad with salmon which was disgusting .
do n't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful .
nice night for a ride across the border but sadly that place just sucks .
unfortunately this is the only restaurant on the lake and they know it .
such a shame they should really get their act together .
no good .
wo n't be coming back .
food just is n't great , never has been .
i feel as though i needed to write this review .
do not waste $ $ on food !
and others as well.
you 've been warned !
this is the worst example of a `` steakhouse '' ever .
tonight was the worst in service and food .
the slaw came and was awful .
they tasted like they had been cooked in burnt grease .
this place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately .
i am sad to see it go down hill .
tonight was a miserable time here .
without fail its always the same .
poor to standard food .
con 's : outdated decor and seating , average food to sub par food .
can be difficult to get a drink sometimes as it does get busy .
today was the worst , though .
i felt bad for the hostess .
gone downhill from the last time i was here .
turned out to be a big disappointment .
french fries were under cooked .
we never lacked for anything .
had two very disappointing dinners here .
our waitress was nice but not very professional .
i am not so sure where that nasty bug ended up .
chicken was dry and the portions were tiny !
nope ... no where to be found on the menu .
after one person took a bite the sour faces were hard to miss !
it was terrible .
after kindly explaining this to my waitress she again was not very professional .
she offered free desert which we did not want because everything else was terrible .
the wrong people are running it .
such a waste !
one exception -- the ribs are not bad and edible !
lousy food .
certainly will not be back !
it could be so much better .
please , if nothing else , clean that place before someone really gets sick !
really makes me wonder how dirty the kitchen is .
went for sunday brunch and was very disappointed .
eggs were cold and the fresh fruit was n't fresh .
there was n't much to choose from on the lunch menu .
worst thing was the loud dance music .
the shrimp in the fish and chips were just terrible .
horrible experience and not worth the money .
the service was incredibly slow .
only had the nachos , which were n't anything special .
so nasty .
every time i 've been here its been worse than the last time .
it 's dirty , food is gross and the wait staff is just pathetic .
decor looks like you have time traveled to _num_ .
but i wo n't be back .
this place is a waste of time .
service is slow and the food is not good at all .
it 's fishy , but it 's not coming from the lake .
that was pretty lame .
my husband was so confused with his sandwich .
it was half a loaf of mini bread with no knife .
it 's dirty , overpriced and the service is poor .
nice location , but i will never go back again .
but the food is horrible .
every appetizer and main dish is horrible .
beer selection is better in my house .
the manager made no effort and allowed me to walk away furious .
i was not the only patron who appeared to have trouble with their order .
simply because of the view i would only go there for a drink .
cocktails were good but menu is very overpriced .
service was just ok .
terrible atmosphere .
very musty , all the decorations appear to be from the early _num_ 's .
you can tell that the place is wiped down but never deep cleaned .
tasted nothing like a carolina burger should .
the chili was tasteless .
the bun was tasteless .
bad all the way around .
which i 'll gladly pay for a fresh ground beef patty .
pitiful excuse for a restaurant .
no leadership in this place .
this place is super gross it 's like eating inside the public toilet .
the food looks like my patients vomit .
food is hit or miss -- usually , miss .
went for brunch .
french toast was like rocks , eggs and sausage were cold .
$ _num_ for two for brunch , not worth it .
food was not very good either .
horrible service ... my husband 's steak came to the table raw !
never checked on , offered additional drinks or dessert .
no apologies for uncooked food !
unfortunately it 's not one of my favorites .
to start , the hostess ' were not very welcoming when we walked in .
no smile , no hi , nothing .
so at this point we were a little taken back but continued in .
just not my kind of place .
i went as part of a group so did not really have a choice .
it was hot - very uncomfortable - inside .
it was loud - very loud - as usual .
the staff is very friendly so that 's why they get _num_ stars .
the owners do nothing to attempt fixing it up .
the food is n't very good at all .
if i could give it no stars , i would .
the place was so disgusting that i had to look up their restaurant rating .
after waiting for a boat slip for _num_ minutes , we finally get in .
we really did n't care where we sat .
we have kids that need to eat and are getting cranky .
it is not a family restaurant .
i would give this place _num_ stars if i could .
bad idea .
we wo n't be going back .
had the chicken salad and lettuce was wilted , fruit was room temp .
chicken wings where not hot .
my wife and i attempted to dine here yesterday and it went very badly .
then my wife and i went to the restroom to wash our hands .
a while later , the waitress refilled our drinks .
it just did n't add up .
the queso dip was cold & thick .
the food was very mediocre .
i will never spend another dime here .
this was the worst mexican food i 've ever had !
the service was slow and prices were way too high for this place !
cheap eats yes but not high quality just typical flavor i guess .
when did simply enjoying the company of your companions fall out of favor ?
too salty to finish .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
for dessert , we shared a peanut butter pie with chocolate sauce .
it 's not bad , but it 's not spectacular .
last time i ate there was the last time .
mushy , times before food was much better .
her steak was over cooked and dry .
i made the mistake of sending mine back .
he had a replacement steak that was just the same as the first .
needless to say , i will not return .
my steak tonight was small in size and one third of it was gristle .
inconsistent service but food is good .
the place always seems busy whether it is happy hour or sunday dinner .
the waitress was a good server so this is solely on tonight 's food .
when anything on the salad is bad , you lose .
i could n't chew the steak .
i just was not going to eat it as i could n't chew it .
i did n't want to talk to the manager .
i was just going to pay for it and leave .
his ribs were refrigerator cold .
i 've already taken the meal off . ''
at that time my husband said he chicken was really good .
we told her just to charge us whatever and we were ready to leave .
i did n't feel the manager was apologetic although she had comped our meal .
she did n't come to our table and apologize for the ribs or chicken .
i would have felt better if she had said that she was sorry .
cold brownie .
our visit on may _num_ was less than stellar .
only came back once to fill our drinks .
my aunt thought she went on a break and did n't bother telling us .
wish i would have chosen some place better to bring my family .
will not be back .
not worth the price for the lousy service we received .
do n't expect great results no matter how much money you spend .
after all that , the treatment didnt work at all .
too bad the man who answers the phone was rude as all heck .
cut me off while talking , was not listening , their loss .
i would n't even bother calling it 's not worth the time .
what an obnoxious , customer unfriendly person .
i would n't even give this place one star .
we use to like this facility very much .
however the facility has also been very accommodating when we needed .
ok for _num_ night stay .
couple running it were very friendly .
biggest peeve is grass not kept .
the worst service and pizza .
they delivered pizza with the wrong toppings .
horrible management and pizza .
looks run down like no one really takes pride in how the restaurant looks .
the fries were horrible .
i wo n't be using the credit towards future business .
they looked like little fat cigarettes !
i had deep fried batter for lunch !
i know my co-workers and i wo n't be coming back .
the service , as mentioned several times in yelp , is really slow .
the restaurant was probably half full of people .
someone else brought us water tho .
nothing much to it at all .
the taste was mediocre .
my co-worker said the omelette was ok .
service was slow and good was ehh .
would not go hear again .
they do not take american express as a side note .
and they taste like cooking oil .
friendly wait staff .
cheese curds , i 've had better .
cod , very dry and still had bones in it .
the guy at the register took my money , did n't say anything else .
seriously the worst pizza hut i 've ever ordered from .
it should n't take more than an hour to make and deliver a pizza .
this is a store that could really use a face lift .
the produce quality was not very good .
not impressed .
seems dated .
produce could use a makeover .
as an added bonus , the ethnic section is a joke .
can we please have a new grocery store already ?
the prices , however , are my biggest beef .
now and then they run a sale : _num_ for $ _num_ .
a _num_ oz .
... hey , how about you just lower your frickin ' prices ?
do n't bother !
oh , wait .
i 've never encountered a company with such an astounding lack of customer service .
just about half the price of the `` promotion '' the representative offered me .
transfer _num_ , to sales !
transfer _num_ , to the internet !
transfer _num_ , to the phone representative ( again ) !
transfer _num_ , to sales ( again ) !
there should be a negative rating on here .
it 's not theirs to make sure it work .
they said they could n't do anything better than their listed rate .
that is how much i hate them .
i have called _num_ times and received incredibly poor service .
avoid this company like the plague .
needs more books and homeless people .
sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine .
waitress amber was courteous and attentive .
if true i am disappointed , al .
boo , bad customer service and not worth the food .
we get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best .
the waitress says she sorry and puts a quick order in right away .
btw they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make .
long story short very disappointed with service and food .
mediocre at best .
it was horrible .
i wo n't be back .
the food was barely warm .
the food is usually good , but today we got the worst service ever .
the employees inside had no idea that there was an order matching our number .
maybe someone gave our order to another customer .
he requested his money back .
nothing here .
service was terrible !
people walked in after us and were seated .
not sure what their structure is for seating , but they suck at it .
i will not be back .
nasty & dirty .
the place is full of regulars drinking cheap beer .
but still way way too crowded .
then someone came over and said hi .
so she then tried to help things along .
tried sitting outside and the waitress did not make us feel welcomed .
she was rude and careless .
we walked inside to the bar where the bartenders were a lot better .
seems like they have enough customers and do not need to be nice anymore .
too bad because the beer was nice and cold .
there were n't many patrons in the dining room .
needless to say , i will not be returning .
service was slow , just getting a drink was an effort .
no way coming back other than drinks in the summer .
ate there last night with a group of friends .
it was cold and tasted very old .
the fries that went along with it were also extremely salty .
now , not worth the salt .
we had a horrible experience here last summer .
decided to give a chance again this summer and it 's worse !
service is slow .
wait staff is not trained .
this had not been discussed at the time of booking a few hours earlier .
cheap bar food .
i was there on monday december _num_ , _num_ .
when it was not on , we went back to the counter .
no one was there .
i waited another _num_ minutes .
tried this because it 's local .
terrible , bland chinese food .
not much else to say .
no , i just got home .
it was another _num_ minutes before i received the correct order .
no offer of a refund .
no sincere apology .
i was wrong .
i tried to ask for some , but she walked away .
the meal was very disappointing to say the least .
the wait staff were completely absent outside of delivering the food .
took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed .
the chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet .
even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce .
the calamari was not tough .
i 'm sorry .
fool me once , shame on you .
fool me twice , shame on me .
dry and flavorless .
the service was also slow .
they refilled our glasses only once , after we had asked for the check .
i wo n't be going back .
the entree my dining companion ordered was also sub-par .
our chicken sizzling rice soup was flavor less and completely watered down .
the staff was very kind but a little annoying .
this is the worst chinese food my entire family has had in years .
we all ordered different things and none of us could eat our meals .
that was $ _num_ wasted .
how do you mess up beef fried rice ?
the mongolian beef had a flavor but it was all wrong .
how do places keep getting good reviews when they are so bad .
so that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering .
there was hardly any meat to be had .
all in all an extreme disappointment .
we ended up tipping and not making a fuss ... just another lesson learned .
the egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer .
the same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon .
not spicy enough , and far too sour .
it was also very greasy and watery , and tasted extremely bland .
waited a full _num_ hours for our food .
talking to friends over the weekend , we were told it was pretty good .
pot stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good .
for hours - over two to be exact .
flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp was n't very spicy at all .
she complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli .
that is not true at all !
i do not recommend this place .
the food was bland , lukewarm and it had texture .
it was n't chicken , and it definitely did n't taste like chicken .
for everyone that gave this place more than one star .
however , lately they have fallen out of bed .
disappointing .
old , old fruit for my garnish in my drink .
for the price , they should have cut fresh fruit .
i 'm a little confused .
it 's basically the typical americanized , overpriced sit-down chinese restaurant .
the bbq pork in our appetizer was almost cold and chewy .
other items on the appetizer platter were okay , but lacked seasoning .
our entrees were n't much better .
the very odd thing about the sauce was that it was too sweet .
just very weird .
no , no .
service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .
the restaurant had several empty tables .
the food was absolutely mediocre .
the only nice thing about this place is the ambiance .
unfortunately the quality of the food is quite low .
the rice , for instance , was the worst i have ever eaten .
i do n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
there are much better chinese restaurants in madison and they are cheaper !
service was very poor , the minute we stepped in .
the restaurant had several empty tables .
the food was absolutely mediocre .
i literally just walked out of the establishment .
she was hesitant to give me a straight up answer .
she said ummm not really !
she needs more training in customer service .
ate here once with a buy one , get one coupon .
i wo n't be heading back .
beans were ok , rice , not so much .
i probably wo n't be back .
not enough servers at their new location .
if you go when it 's busy , beware .
this was somewhat disturbing seeing as they are constantly touching dirty plates and towels .
the chips ... kinda bad .
super weird consistency and zero salt .
our second basket was better , but still lacking .
the salsa was ok ... not amazing but not bad .
he said no problem .
i 'm eating very slowly because i want that hot sauce .
it 's now been probably _num_ min since my margarita came .
bottom line , drinks : yay !
it was a certified used vehicle so it was still under warranty .
i just wish that 's who we would 've went to first .
his level of customer service was appalling .
i complained but got nowhere .
excuse me ?
it is $ _num_ just to walk in the door .
_num_ - the locker rooms are old and sort of creepy .
you probably are n't either .
am i going to stop going there as a result ?
no , it 's too convenient .
the lava cakes were barely cooked and therefore inedible .
the pizza was not bad .
which i guess explains the attitudes of the staff .
this michael 's location is a disaster .
they do n't have really any good stores that make me stop and shop .
there really is no big draw .
on top of all this the location is horrible .
the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth .
service has always been very slow , despite _num_ baristas working at the counter .
horrible , horrible , horrible service .
slow , unfriendly staff who refuse to even talk to you sometimes !
i did not leave a tip .
they staff is friendly enough , but they are still a service biased company .
is annoying , but not the end of the world .
i think i even gave them good reviews in here before .
dude thought he should argue with me about it so i got a refund .
went there on saturday night to get some food to go .
on of the worst chinese buffets i 've seen .
half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty .
very little selection .
that being said , i would not recommend the place to friends .
some of the food on the buffet is quite good .
not sure why i keep deciding to come back here .
no thanks .
this buffet is by far the worst buffet i 've ever been to .
the fried rice was only a little and old and hard .
waiting to see if they would bring any new food out ... but nope .
they would not bring any food out until dinner time which is 4pm .
we could n't stay and wait one more hour until they serve dinner .
and there was no other customers but us .
what a waste of money !
the worst part is , i got sick for _num_ days after .
worst place ever !
this is just ridiculous in this day and age to not accept cards .
even worse is the bs sign on the register .
but seriously _num_ min for a slice of quiche and a breakfast sandwich ?
we told them just make the drinks , forget the food .
even so the drinks took _num_ minutes .
would not recommend until they work their production issues out .
disappointed .
hire another cook and install another stove .
but very slow service , and overpriced .
only takes cash or check !
ugh .
i wo n't be wasting my money again .
i 'm confused why anyone would choose to go here .
i ordered the thai curry noodles .
not impressed .
i 've never tasted something that claimed to be curry with so little flavor .
my vegetables were obviously charred and they still sent me the dish .
not even the chili garlic sauce did much to it .
almost thought i was in los angeles again .
this is not very good asian food .
i would suggest that there must be a better choice in madison .
i am sure there are asians in madison .
i am sure chin 's would not be on their list .
i 've never dined in , so i wo n't comment on atmosphere .
for the most part , i 've had ok experiences with the food selections .
it 's nothing really special .
i ordered a shrimp and veggie stir fry to go .
yeah , next time i 'll get my own lunch .
i ate it but will definitely not go there again !
it fell short in ambiance and flavor for me .
i did n't feel like this had a lot of flavor .
it was awkward .
it went on for about _num_ minutes and really made my stop there interesting .
after cream cheese wontons , pad thai is one of my favorite asian entrees .
dull gray , soupy , greasy , salty and watery , yet somehow sticky .
epic fail on this entree .
instead , however , they were the same brown color as the fried rice .
my last fortune cookie said i 'll probably return to chin 's .
we tried to order for delivery because we are _num_ miles away .
on their menu it says $ _num_ minimum .
i was n't paying for a meal twice and getting attitude from this guy .
terrible customer service !
not very friendly to start .
not very consistent with service or procedures .
i will not be back .
poorly run .
panda is doing better then this .
no sweet , no sour .
not so freshly made !
so we left never going back first and last !
i called to find out what was on the hot and spicy chicken .
on top of that , there was no broccoli .
it was cut so thin and had no chicken flavor .
fairly basic .
i wo n't return there .
the service is less than stellar .
plus , i do n't care for the taste of their ice cream .
maybe it is just me , but i think it 's overrated .
the texture is far too gooey for my liking .
* flavor - the ice cream here is too sweet .
it 's really kind of a depressing place to visit now .
i do n't recommend going there .
my wife ended up waiting _num_ minutes for this .
as we were waiting , i noticed how dirty the entire interior was .
it looks like the floors and base boards have not cleaning in months .
i did not check the bathrooms , too scared to try .
it is a waste of time and money .
one was apple pie and the other was cheesecake .
it looks terrible does n't it ?
either i was _num_ ] not a regular or _num_ ] a bother .
darts , pool , tuesday blues night ( live blues band !
it 's not so bad , but it 's just not that good .
we had pizza there the other night and i could taste the freezer burn .
sorry , boar - the truth can hurt .
so yeah , no . ''
rude .
excuse me for wanting to try your establishment .
so disappointing that 's how people think a business should be run .
my latest visit was not the best .
fine ... no big deal , i got to use my coupon .
so much for being a loyal customer .
unfortunately we choose cousins .
we got there and ordered _num_ subs with fries and cheese curds .
it took us nearly _num_ minutes to get our food .
there were _num_ men making subs and taking orders , it was moderately busy .
it 's absolutely pathetic and borderline useless .
poor customer service .
unfortunately , we were unable to drink this bottle of wine .
we took one sip and realized it was bad .
the nose was off , and so was the taste .
they have decent drink specials .
ive never had their food but ive heard its pretty decent .
overall it an ok place to go to get a few drinks .
sadly its one of the better bars in middleton .
little disappointed with my beer too .
there were maybe _num_ people there , all sitting at the bar .
maybe they only serve locals .
there were n't remotely interested in us or our business .
wednesday night , september _num_ , _num_ .
sunday morning , was looking forward to a bloody mary .
after over _num_ minutes we left .
was n't even busy , one bartender was standing around doing nothing .
i was really excited to come here and usually really like cajun food .
i could n't finish it and left hungry .
i 'm hoping it was just a mistake .
yelpers , you let me down !
boy , it was a huge disappointment .
bisque was on the salty side , but it was ok with the bread .
i wish i could have stopped my meal here ... .
so i ordered that just to try the raspberry dressing , and huge disappointment .
it came with this layer of oil , and not enough `` sauce '' .
when i poured onto my salad it was just drenched in oil .
i did n't even eat the salad .
i only ate the shrimp .
the service was soooooo slow that night .
ugh .
then , it was an even longer wait to order dinner .
our empty plates sat on our table for _num_ minutes .
i got tired of trying to flag someone down all evening .
there was no bam !
completely disgusting !
what a mess of a hotel .
the hotel was totally booked .
of course the hostess acted like an office temp , with a bad attitude .
i could n't check out of that hotel fast enough .
lesson learned for next time .
unacceptable !
service was terrible .
one of the guests had to wait about _num_ minutes for the meal .
horrible !
it 's hard to believe this is a marriott property .
it greatly lacks attention to detail .
i immediately changed rooms and the tv did not work .
all of the power in the room was then knocked out .
i was lucky my computer was not fried .
i will not stay here again and do not recommend it for business travelers .
_num_ ) what the hell is with the _num_ lbs .
which is n't enough .
seriously , you really expect people to use these pieces of junk ?
bedding was stained on pillow and comforter .
after arriving back at the hotel , bedding had not been changed .
not acceptable .
the food on the other hand was overpriced and gross .
i complained , they said sorry and that was it .
platinum member service my butt .
despite having over _num_ rooms , they only have _num_ elevators .
the food is also terrible and overpriced .
checked in to a room on the 6th floor ( out of _num_ ) .
eventually one of them fell ... .
this marriott kind of feels like an airport hotel .
both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up _num_ to _num_ levels high .
it is only a _num_ to _num_ minute drive to madison though .
this marriott would not be a good property for a long stay .
this hotel just does not feel fresh enough .
and i 've been marriott platinum for _num_ years !
worst marriott experience in twenty years of traveling .
the hotel manager is a joke and very rude .
terrible value .
this place should be like $ _num_ a night .
during the wedding , all i saw was how things were going wrong .
so unfortunately , i did n't enjoy majority of my reception .
first night not so great .
immediately apparently means _num_ minutes later after you call again to the front desk .
no one in the room next to me , alarm clock goes off .
waited _num_ minutes , and called back .
cold showers two morning 's in a row .
they do n't give a darn .
it is loud and noisy , seems like lots of kids running around .
i could n't get out fast enough .
if i could give this hotel zero stars , i would .
when i checked out , no one asked me how my stay was .
_num_ days later they sprayed that again .
more than one occasion they came before the agreed upon time .
i asked for a delivery time and it came _num_ mins early .
i just gave up .
the coin operated laundry was another in consistent experience .
the dispenser in the laundry room was broken .
the girl behind the desk told me it was $ _num_ per box .
this hotel was a mistake from beginning to end .
honestly i am not convinced our billing ever did get corrected .
do n't stay here if a good night 's sleep is your goal .
even complaining to management does n't do any good .
this one is a big fail .
what i found was a large room filled with unappetizing , boring baked goods .
nothing in here did i want , or have any desire to try .
chocolate chip , peanut butter , sugar ?
when i picked up the cake the following week it was stale .
: ( disappointing .
it was n't as good as i had hoped .
i like my croissants light , buttery , and flakey .
sadly , my croissant was none of these things .
i was n't pleased with it .
i responded back to the email and never received and sort of follow up .
disappointing .
this is very misleading .
if i could give this place _num_ stars , i would .
hotel was clean and service was meh .
she said she would n't know til _num_ .
i did n't hear from them at all which is so annoying .
the alarm clock was off by almost a half hour .
their wake up call was also about _num_ mins off .
i stayed at the hilton garden inn the friday night before my wedding .
walls are thin .
she just looked through the lost & found list without putting me on hold .
then she suggested i leave a voicemail for brenda the head of housekeeping .
their staff is dishonest and unprofessional .
do not stay here .
the staff is very rude .
very disappointed .
the pizza is what you expect , nothing better than ok .
that sucks .
gross !
i generally love papa johns , but this one is lacking in all areas .
apart from that , the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service .
the three people i dealt with were all rude and careless .
initially , they ended up giving me a $ _num_ credit .
you could have fooled me .
that was disappointing .
nothing to write home about .
so , better pizza ?
are you kidding me ?
sorry papa john .
i checked with them if they deliver and they said yes .
the store manager 's attitude was horrible .
i will never order pizza from this store nor any people i know !
i was so disappointed after reading all of the reviews .
sandwiches come with chips , not fries .
the total was just under $ _num_ without tip .
if not , plan on spending about three times too much there .
trying to get the check out of her was terrible .
in short , we will never return .
the scene reminds me of ... a garage .
seriously that is what we were told .
sorry to hear your mom was a lousy cook .
yes the food is pretty bad .
why people go here i ca n't understand .
i gave it three visits before passing judgement .
as one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily .
taste was just ok.
wo n't be going back .
how this place has _num_ stars i do not understand .
but the bacon was under cooked and pretty soggy .
the pancakes were pretty tasty , though .
my boyfriend ordered eggs with bacon and toast and complained about the same things .
his eggs were under cooked and the bacon was again , soggy .
the toast was fine but how can you really mess up toast ?
service was super slow .
our meal was $ _num_ and probably should have cost around $ _num_ .
not to mention the surprise that they do n't take credit cards .
the moment i walked in i regretted it immediately .
the smell is terrible , like stale cigarette smoke .
the eggs were under done but the toast was fine .
needless to say i am in the market for a new barber .
very unhappy with my haircut .
walked in and got an app .
she took off about _num_ inches made me look like a five year old .
the worst .
not cool .
this is by far the worst ups store i have dealt with .
i live no where near middleton and refuse to pick it up .
if i could give this zero stars , i would .
there was no one else in the store .
you wo n't be getting my business ever again .
nonetheless , i will never spend another dollar in this place .
on another note , the people at fedex were pretty nice .
very unprofessional ... just ca n't trust them .
if you can , avoid the surly dude there fine most of the time .
cheap food , but everything fried on a friday tastes like fish .
i do n't know prices .
_num_ stars : the food is terrible .
terrible .
_num_ star : the service was lacking .
overall , _num_ stars .
was fairly busy but not packed .
was told it would n't be long .
promptly left , wo n't be back .
menu was full of bland comfort food .
entire place smelled like vomit and was dirty .
average service , below average food and terrible atmosphere .
i wanted to like it , i really did .
the waiter seated us -- close to the kitchen , i realized with disappointment .
his french onion soup was decent , but my salad was lacking .
i was disappointed when my next piece was also quite fatty .
i pushed the dish off to the side and settled for my potato .
over all , it just was n't enjoyable .
menu was extremely limited .
the third possible main dish was trout and i forget the fourth .
the desert had no prices .
trust me , this place is a bust .
i wish i could review that lady on here .
especially when the one cashier is sooooooo slow .
a drive thru is suppose a little quicker service of getting your food .
and the food was not worth the price i paid for it .
this is not the first time i 've had this kind of service there .
the people working there also do n't seem like they want to be there .
i do n't know why i even tried going back .
the selection looked appetizing , but tasted horrible .
the waitress was poor .
really tasteless and not good .
some pieces were way over cooked .
big mistake .
the food was awful .
too bad the food was n't .
i would be embarrassed to serve this !
ca n't justify going back ... .
the _num_ rating is only because our server was awesome .
it 's to bad this attitude does n't extend to the kitchen .
the kitchen does n't seem to care about customer service .
kitchen does not care .
the kitchen does not know the meaning of hospitality .
went for mother 's day brunch and it was n't good at all .
tried to purchase some dj equipment from this company .
i run several companies and have never run into to this .
does n't make sense especially in this economy .
delicate product was not shipped with appropriate packaging .
i wo n't be ordering again .
i really wish i had read these reviews before ordering from this company .
i selected overnight shipping because i really needed them the next day .
after all day i never received a shipping confirmation so i called again .
still no confirmation yet after _num_ days .
if i could give them _num_ stars .
the meh : the hushpuppies were 1/2 way decent , but nothing extraordinary .
no honey offered with them though .
i 'm going to have to revisit in the near future to investigate .
i do n't know why anyone would go here twice .
so disappointed .
the food is n't fresh .
sandwiches and burgers do not come with fries or anything .
atmosphere was awful .
my experiences in this store have not been good for some years now .
not only is the quality bad , but the service is horrendous .
getting a fitting room in that place is a disaster .
nobody greets you when you walk in .
( customer service _num_ ) .
i 've been three times and each time sucked more than the time before .
disgusting .
you are a mess !
an absolute mess .
and you 're consistently a mess .
this place needs an iron fist .
the burgers are okay , but there are better ones in madison .
our burgers were unremarkable - not that flavorful or moist .
the buffalo wings were greasy and actually not hot when we got them .
tonight 's offering was a step above cafeteria chicken strips .
for almost $ _num_ , i 'm calling this a total bust .
this place does n't suck , but it 's not very good .
with chicken , it cost $ _num_ .
no no no .
it was scary pink and super soft -- like raw hamburger generally is .
i 'm not .
the food is so-so at best .
why bother to pay for a premium products if they are n't properly prepared .
this meal was a disappointment .
also , the french fries had probably been prepared _num_ minutes previous .
the waitress even apologized for her lack of attention .
gave us free drinks , and coupons .
this place is usually a fave but the recently its been not so good .
it took our party of _num_ two hours to get our food .
our family of six went there may _num_ , _num_ at 5:30 pm .
all we ordered was hamburgers and chicken sandwiches .
it was n't even busy and it was on a wednesday night .
do n't worry i did n't know about them until i came to wisconsin .
i am going to do my car at home from now on .
had i known , i would certainly made a reservation .
does not live up to a recent review in madison paper .
cons : too pricey & ala carte .
the entrees : $ _num_ - _num_ .
unbelievably disappointed .
i 'm in town for business , and went on a week night .
the bread i wish were warm .
not going back .
we were very disappointed .
the noodles were just falling apart .
so we 'll probably not ever go back .
i ca n't believe people rate this four stars on average .
hit or miss .
mostly miss actually .
they also use poor quality cheeses that had little flavor .
we were not too impressed .
we were staying in madison and drove over _num_ minutes to get here .
i wish we would n't have wasted our time .
we wo n't waste our time going back .
ick .
maybe i 'm just bitter .
cold .
the food is nothing worth writing home about .
unfortunately , the beer is n't cheap , nor were there other obvious specials .
_num_ on a friday night with two of my buddies .
we all got the fish fry plus some deep fried shrimp .
service was attentive , but everything seemed to go wrong .
cole saw sucked , it was soggy lettuce smothered in warm mayonnaise .
terrible service .
very rude and the managers seem to treat their employees with no respect .
food is ok but not worth a trip over to this joint .
i do n't recommend .
bad experience .
burger was okay , but over cooks and not very flavorful .
fried chips and onion rings were not good either .
this place is awful .
rubber greasy curds .
dirty greasy chicken fingers and very small portions .
the food is not so great and neither is the beer on tap .
stopped in for breakfast on sunday .
how hard is it to screw up breakfast ?
not again .
stopped here for the 1st ( & last ) time around 1:30 friday afternoon .
six of us went here for friday night fish .
the salad bar is not beautiful as was described by another reviewer .
the fish was edible , but there is way better fish fry out there .
it could stand a few updates .
it is a terrible place to see live music .
if you are not facing the stage , the sound is terrible .
there is limited table space in the bar in general .
ordered a chicken quesadilla for an app which was really good .
had a hamburger wrap for meal which i did n't care for .
menu is typical bar food .
after a long while we realized she must have left for good !
she was really busy and she looked surprised we needed the check .
seems like our waitress had n't told her .
she was busy and nice ... still just took along time .
the corn sat there the whole time we ate our meal .
i wo n't be back .
shame on you jiffy lube !
did someone over rate this place ?
well they missed the boat .
my omelette was weak at best , and i mean weak .
it as over cooked and anything but an omelette .
not just a lot , but dripping and soggy .
c 's is just a greasy spoon .
needless to say one guy was outside and one inside .
crappy customer service .
worst service ever .
terrible customer service .
was not allowed to talk to a manager when requested .
the door locks are a joke .
it could be worse i guess .
my rating used to be four stars , yes that 's four stars .
i would n't even give this one star now .
living here has turned out to be a complete nightmare .
they are not military friendly at all , they claim to be .
the bruce company is very , very expensive .
i left and went to ace hardware on university avenue .
yes , i was a little stressed .
she would n't give me an answer .
poor service , high prices , crappy selection .
fail .
not to my surprise , no one showed .
_num_ ) the customer service at this store is terrible .
the employees are rude , particularly scott who works in the plant section .
_num_ ) the plants this past summer were infested .
disgusting .
alas , customer service is poor .
so i left .
i 've been a bruce co customer for well over a decade .
after today , i will never be back .
excuse me ?
no apologies .
rating is really _num_ and based upon the beers sampled .
lots of options but not that great .
our tour guide was the worst tour guide i 've ever had .
many of us realized she was completely clueless .
at least _num_ in one room of the tour .
the beer garden was out of the most popular styles .
shirt sizes in the gift shop were limited .
too bad i 'm on vacation now .
the free pint glass & four samples were n't worth the $ _num_ .
the only positive was the food provided by a local restaurant .
i got _num_ dozen donuts , and it was $ _num_ !
maybe they deserve _num_ stars .
we just picked up a custom cake for a colleague 's going away .
holy crap , it 's crap looking .
he showed me the old one and it was black as night .
now , i 'm _num_ miles away and ca n't do anything about it .
i would never rent here again .
very disappointed in this operation .
biggest disappointment was they smoked in my vehicle while installing .
now ever time i get in i smell cigarettes .
or maybe just feel like it .
my expectations were not that high .
the food is mediocre , even for fast foot 's low standards .
slow service .
absolutely unreasonable .
i would give this bk a _num_ star if i could .
the wait in the drive-thru is painfully slow !
this bk needs better management and training for the employees .
they just do n't seem to care .
avoid at all costs !
_num_ minutes to get my order .
terrible service !
not acceptable !
have been there several times and it 's always super slow .
we stood there for _num_ minutes waiting for somebody to take our order .
unless you like being ignored , avoid , avoid , avoid !
stopped in for lunch today and the place was pretty much empty .
not even worth one star !
i went through the drive through , with about _num_ cars ahead of me .
waste of my time and money !
everything at this bk takes ten minutes .
does n't matter what you order , be prepared to wait .
this place is a hole .
why does the food taste weird ?
this place is slow beyond belief .
i waited _num_ min for my order which was wrong and cold .
awesome !
worst bk i 've ever been to !
should take _num_ minutes to get a nice cream cone .
worst bk ever .
avoid !
still very slow service at drive through .
no wonder there are never cars outside !
the cheese burgers are quite gross .
the cheese is what i imagine fake , fake cheese is like .
the chicken nuggets and sandwiches are also passable .
however i do not plan on visiting another burger king any time soon .
literally on even one croutons or slice of tomato nothing but shredded lettuce .
i let it ring about _num_ times and then hung up .
same deal : lots of ringing , no answering .
i let it ring another _num_ times or so and just gave up .
i do n't mind having someone answer and then immediately put me on hold .
it 's a lot better than the nothing that i got .
thumbs down .
for a taco bell , this one is horrible .
this is the most amazingly slow drive through ever !
never , ever go here .
like over cooked and then sat out for a couple of hours .
then i drove back and went inside and i talked to the manager .
pointed out the problem and asked them if they would eat something like that .
doing some food prep for my job , i called bs on her .
in the end , would not recommend the taco bell .
so slow .
instead of offering napkins the girl just shut the window & turned around .
horrible service .
taco bell back then only existed in south western states .
this is the worst taco bell i 've ever been to .
tonight we placed an order got home and half the order was wrong .
their food is terrible if you ever get it .
plus , they never get it right .
wait time in the drive thru runs between _num_ to _num_ minutes !
worst taco bell ever !
horrible place & service .
there is always something missing from the drive thru order .
and the service is always painfully slow .
they told me it would be $ _num_ .
unfortunately at this location i was n't given a chance to get a pizza .
i walked into the store at _num_ minutes to 8pm .
you do n't even bake the pizza !
my first time at this location and was disappointing .
place was dirty and the worst pizza ever .
for $ _num_ that is a rip off , a joke and unacceptable !
boy , was i disappointed !
so that was ridiculous right off the bat .
sadly , this was not the case .
but i highly doubt we 'll make our way there any time soon .
ordered egg rolls , steamed dumplings , garlic beef and orange chicken .
tasted low quality .
the garlic beef was cold and the meat was very fatty .
extremely low quality chicken on the orange chicken .
food was just low quality .
so , i stand and wait .
not saying they had to immediately hand me my order , but come on !
do yourself a favor , avoid this place .
not overly impressed .
pretty bland for chinese take out .
do n't bother .
this place is sort of gross .
next , the shopping experience was n't much better .
no one ever greeted me or asked if i needed help .
the inside of the building smells really bad .
i did not like my experience , and i wo n't go back .
but we would n't know because no one ever came to the counter .
we arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli .
not much interest in those , huh ?
it 's just not worth it .
the building has been recently remodeled because it burned .
gross .
it was 2pm on sat and dead .
no excuse for dirty .
the waitress was really nice , i think her name was sarah .
i 'm not joking .
it 's just a numbers thing at this point .
two of those came wrong again .
too little too late .
kids got hot dogs , ugh , just buy a better brand people !
unbelievable and with my little girl there .
disgusting ... .
food sucked and i through left overs and cake in garbage .
had n't been to this restaurant in yrs and will never go again !
i 'm not sure what all the rave reviews for this place are about .
you should never have to wait that long at a diner !
sorry , but it was .
the pita bread was not pita , but large tortilla .
needless to say , i will not be back again .
poor quality food , very typical american fare .
our server screwed up both our orders , would n't recommend to anyone .
warm old school feel is ruined by lack of food quality .
this location does not have good service .
any other kfc would be better .
well , my first time was typical mediocre kfc .
then i made the bold , yet stupid decision to dine here again .
the tv reception is absolutely horrible .
finally , after my pushing , she looked it up on my file .
i 'll buy my product there from now on .
the previous review i wrote was pretty bad .
the selection was slim to non .
the employees at this location vary from indifferent to pretty helpful .
no big deal , right ?
this was in no way faster than just going through a regular register .
having the last part be the worst part did n't help .
this is not unusual for wally world these days .
no one said a word .
i 'm not even sure they noticed .
could have been a bad day but will never come here again .
i wish i could leave zero stars , but that 's not an option .
so probably expecting too much .
i 'm embarrassed to be writing this review .
just be very cautious when dealing with this dr .
avoid this place .
piss poor customer service doesnt even begin to cover it .
dont hire these people .
walked by , saw me , and kept going without any acknowledgement .
bottom line : this pharmacy has bad customer service .
i worked at a walmart pharmacy years ago , as a technician .
as with any retail business , employees come and go rather quickly .
she 's been there for _num_ years , she told me so .
it 's completely hit or miss with customer service .
all this time i 've managed to avoid them , except for once .
let me break it down for ya .
hide the powdered doughnuts . ''
i felt sorry for the bride and groom .
the place was not clean for starters .
the food was the worst part .
i had the sirloin , it was cold , chewy , and bland .
food is below average and pricey .
the place looks really good but i was really disappointed with their food .
almost everything sucks in their menu except the omelette and bacon .
omelette was one of the item which did n't disappoint me .
the maple syrup was n't up to the mark .
donuts sucked .
sausage and scrambled egg were okay .
cakes were n't good .
the staff were n't friendly enough .
they did n't even take care of us properly .
they were in bloody hurry always though it was just a brunch going on .
they were not changing or replacing the dishes on the buffet counter .
i did n't like the food and the service at this place .
i do n't know how it would be if i order from the menu .
but they did n't pull off the brunch properly .
the cost of the food was n't worth it at all .
it was a waste of money .
i left the place unsatisfied and disappointed .
additionally the fish was not hot , fishy tasting and overall not good .
we sat down and had to wait _num_ more minutes for a menu .
whatever the reason , this has not been an enjoyable experience .
do n't go in the drive thru if there are more than _num_ cars .
you will sit there for _num_ minutes .
bland burgers , bland hot dogs , and expensive as all get up .
so needless to say we did n't ask for a single sample .
next time we will not going back .
the cheddar tasted sweet ( i know , weird , right ? )
the port wine cheese spread was okay but nothing special .
disappointed .
clean , noisy room .
very poor breakfast .
coffee horrible .
did not give ana or aaron discount as they said they would .
your just going to waste your money !
no , it is n't .
grey is grey and pink is pink .
even into high school in the 90s i continued to shop here happily .
i 'd even like to give you _num_ stars for effort .
horrible .
it is difficult to even find one .
unfortunately , my insurance does not allow me to go many places .
i have really tried to avoid going again .
then i did it , i made an appointment .
evening , busy time .
ok , maybe they are a little late .
apparently another appointment was waiting .
no one bothered to tell me that they were running late .
i do not know , i do not know .
all in all , i 'd pass on this store .
might be the worst vinyl focused store i 've been into .
we are shopping on amazon tonight .
he tried to make me feel like it was my fault .
nope .
not going to spend money here again .
it was not appealing to me .
easily the worst chinese food that i 've eaten .
our general tso 's chicken was terrible .
very bland and overcooked .
the flavor was also very strange , and tasted like ketchup .
just terrible .
the crab rangoon were n't much better .
the interior of this joint is also disgusting .
wallpaper is peeling off the walls , and in general it looked filthy .
customer service was also really bad .
we stopped in around _num_ pm and it was completely dead .
avoid .
only rice and onions .
especially if they request them !
ordered the mongolian beef combo and fried dumplings .
i 'm not sure what was delivered , but it was not mongolian beef .
wo n't eat here again .
the food was nasty .
the language barrier was rough as well .
to make matters worse the food was barely lukewarm .
i wo n't be ordering from this place again anytime soon .
beef curry was okay .
call them on their crap !
the staff sucks beyond rude .
should n't be in business .
do n't know how to make drinks .
do n't waste your time or money going to this place .
the nut job lady in the morning needs to be on meds .
the problem i have over and over is the service .
three times ive been in and every time they are under staffed .
tonight i ordered the chimichangas .
instead of one big one , you get two smaller ones .
they also offer flautas , i wonder if they 're just the same thing .
not sure what all the hype is about .
no vegetarian options , and staff always too busy and not personable .
they never check my online order !
i called an hour later and they had not even started to cook !
not worth the time !
it was horrible !
fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only !
no flavor .
the chicken dishes had fat on the meat .
i had high hopes , and they simply could n't have fallen farther .
i had tofu mixed vegetables , which is my go-to .
just no .
the vegetables were not just mediocre quality , but clearly past their prime .
i 'm talking soggy , wilted , and literally , barely even edible .
in conclusion , poor quality food , questionable sanitation , very very limited seating .
i ordered takeout from here tonight .
i probably wo n't be going back here .
the soup was so bad , i could not finish it .
i would not feed it to company at my home .
i live _num_ minutes away , food took _num_ hours to get here .
i complained and they said they would make me more soup .
i will not go back to this hole in the wall dump .
this is the closet i 've come , much to my disappointment .
in my phoenix and dragon i had five `` jumbo '' shrimps .
which are really just average sized shrimp .
some one else mentioned in this that they do n't really have much crab .
i suppose the worst part was delivery time .
the confirmation email does n't come with a estimated delivery .
_num_ minute mark rolls around and we have n't gotten a call .
_num_ minutes later we 're still waiting .
a little less than _num_ minutes later and it arrives .
the driver apologized and it was still hot .
the food was so dry .
no taste .
no flavor .
so bland .
have to say i wo n't be ordering here again .
the food i received from china wok was dry and tasteless .
it was unprofessional and annoying to other residents of our building .
i wo n't order from here again , ever .
disgusting !
half way through there was a hair in my sub .
i will not go back to this place again .
bad business , bad service .
place is trashy ... so is the guy whose family owns the place .
this place is truly awful .
visited last saturday evening and nothing was `` good '' .
the food was very meh ... _num_ people dined .
the potato skins were so dried out they were mostly inedible .
not too thrilled with the value of a groupon from sports pub .
that was not the case .
biggest waste of $ _num_ i 've ever spent .
you really should n't even think of going here during lunch .
they have one cash register at the front of the store .
nothing more , nothing else .
i was really dissatisfied that not one was hot enough to eat .
i physically left my whole meal and tray on the table and walked out .
no amount of ketchup could make me eat it .
i will probably not go back to this location again .
this is the worst fast food franchise in town .
the drive through is slow .
the food is inconsistent .
worst bk i 've ever been to .
when i left the car behind me followed as well .
it does n't matter the time of day .
ordered chicken tenders they were out .
ok can we have four cheeseburgers no we are out of buns .
i ordered sausage croissant meal w coffee to go .
sigh .
boy , did i regret doing that favor for her .
the employees seem slow , stupid , and lazy .
like they have no idea what they are doing .
running out of fries ?
looked online and saw it opens at _num_ am on weekdays .
they should close it down at this point .
the old kind .
never eaten here .
cash only and they 're out of fries .
not a big deal , but did n't have cash .
second time i pull up , drive thru box is still broken !
i wait _num_ minutes to get to the window to order .
i wait three more minutes before driving away .
madison public health department had burger king hire a pest control company .
i , for one , will never be eating here .
so bizarre .
customer service that is apathetic at best , rude at worst .
i just do n't care much today . ''
no eye contact , no smile .
this is typical of the service .
i was n't too bothered , as it rang up clearance price .
the fabric selection is not what it once was , either .
a store is pretty much worthless if you cant pay for the items .
so not a great visit but not the worst , either .
horrible customer service .
did n't want to spend time on me because of people behind me .
continued doing nothing .
i wo n't return to this location .
she was a counter waiting to get cut .
much better burgers and sandwiches in madison for a much more reasonable price .
overall , one of the worst restaurant experiences for me .
staff was friendly and service was fairly prompt .
the food was merely average and the `` specially brewed '' beer was weak .
overall , the place tries too hard with its theme .
not a day to encourage diners to eat on the patio .
i got so sick and was throwing up after eating there !
and normally i never get sick to my stomach .
no , no , never , never , uh uh uh !
sorry to say , this place is a disaster .
the food was cold , overcooked , tasteless and a little scary .
if i could give no stars this would be the place that deserves it .
there were a handful of patrons ( certainly more staff than paying customers ) .
disgusting !
do n't waste you time here !
cheeseburger was not all that .
it was disgusting .
the sweet potato chips were n't much better ; too greasy and stale .
it was acceptable , but the taste was off .
the service was n't good either .
i will not be back .
i was sick for _num_ days after i eat one of their burgers .
instead , all they serve up here is hamburgers with fancy names .
i doubt it was a chef .
if you 're looking for paradise you wo n't find it here .
but i have had lame burgers there too .
if you are still reading ... .
i had the mini crab burgers and they were pretty good .
service was mediocre .
however , i was surprised by the reasonable beer selection and the nice menu .
the big problem with cheeseburger was the service .
finish eating , wait _num_ minutes for the check .
not going back , even though the food was fine .
greasy food , lazy service , flat soda .
for a place the is supposed to specialize in burgers they sucked !
i got the guacamole bacon burger .
it was tasty but the burger itself was overly greasy .
the drink service was incredibly slow , and the food service was okay .
a disappointing trip , and we likely wo n't be back anytime soon .
do n't waste your money or time .
it was horrible .
awful , sums up my first impression of the place .
how hard is it to wipe off the booth .
portions are weak however .
a big mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here .
first was the lack of caring when it came to the booth 's cleanliness .
second , i never got a refill on my soda .
for $ _num_ , i 'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda .
it took our waitress nearly _num_ minutes to collect come back with our bill .
she then acted annoyed that we did n't want something other than water !
i will not be coming back .
also , why close the bar _num_ minutes early ?
i 'm just beyond put off .
nobody was cleaning up the place !
our food was barely edible .
stay away from this restaurant until they fix their issues .
so the food was average , not great .
the service was rushed and unfriendly .
not worth the price .
disappointing .
however , the dishes we got were n't particularly good either .
skip this place .
i wish i could give this place no stars .
disgusting !
got sick from this place twice !
pretty unfortunate event ... .
worst italian we have ever had .
called to get takeout and was greeted by a nasty host .
we will never return to this restaurant for food .
horrible service , and sub-par food .
my stuff was stolen from my room .
going to file a police report .
pet friendly and low cost .
it 's ok for low cost , but keep your expectations low .
worst red roof inn i have ever stayed in .
bed comforter had dried stains on it as well .
it was absolutely gross .
if i could , i would give this place zero stars .
the front desk attendant was dead inside , and the room was absolutely disgusting .
we stayed here for _num_ nights this weekend .
our bathroom was disgusting .
it also was extremely slow .
do not stay here .
no idea !
it certainly was n't clean though .
i also have no idea what was in the water .
i 'm beyond upset with red roof inn , madison .
please do not stay here .
the service is so annoying .
april _num_ i entered boston store in east town mall in madison wisconsin .
i said `` why do n't you have locks on the dressing room doors ?
she had no response to my question .
i believe this is every woman 's worst nightmare !
she did n't seem to care .
he may have known there were no locks and followed me into dressing room .
odd smell .
very disappointed .
it was sub par and i returned it anyways .
doubt i 'll be back .
poor food handling practices !
i was really excited to try this place as the reviews were excellent .
major disappointment !
we ordered a couple of beers and they were prompt but not really cold .
they looked like they had never been washed .
last i checked , those practices could send someone to the hospital !
we will not be going back !
i think i may have been wrong .
the show was good enough but everything else was just meh .
let 's begin with the parking situation .
there is no parking situation .
i think i am going to stick to that for this venue as well .
the seats are cramped and uncomfortable .
do n't even want to mention the bathrooms , dirty taps and awful popcorn .
but my biggest beef of all is the lack of reserved seating .
why make people wait outside for an hour or more to attend an event .
sorry , it is just stupid .
worst security at any venue i have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks .
$ _num_ for a double ?
personally , i will not be attending any other performances here .
i needed new glasses , so prescription in hand i went shopping for frames .
not quite .
will not use them again .
if i could give zero stars i would .
i am very disappointed that my review today has to to be negative .
i returned a car today at hertz at the madison airport .
she could care less and was extremely rude .
i have never been treated so horribly before .
well , go here if you want inconsistent pricing and condescending management .
edit - the less expensive store was the highly rated park street location .
i have never been so poorly treated by any business , ever .
i will not be returning to any midas location ever again .
pain in the neck , right ?
the tech put the bulb in and apparently it blew almost instantly .
that 's just not right .
stayed on a business trip seeking to save money on the nightly rate .
skip the complimentary breakfast as the choices are slim and offerings looked old .
good location , low prices , below par rooms .
my room was dirty .
the rooms had a stale , mildew smell .
ugh .
my blanket has burn holes in it .
breakfast was crappy and there are always shady people in the parking lot .
negative stars .
the service , however , needs help , literally .
the small staff could just not get people to tables quickly enough !
everyone was working hard , they just need more people !
we drank too much coffee with all this waiting .
it was pretty busy so we waited for maybe _num_ minutes before being seated .
horrible service .
$ _num_ off our bill .
worst experience in service we 've ever had !
manager is very inexperienced .
fix your wifi for _num_ stars .
the jambalaya and gumbo seemed blah to both of us .
obviously the cook does not know that .
nothing had a cajun seasoning to it .
they are probably fake reviews by friends .
owner says i am not cajun .
i , on the other hand had an absolutely pitiful shrimp po boy .
take a bite , and all you taste is bread .
it was ok buy upset my stomach .
cornbread was dense and moist ?
flavorless though .
can i give zero stars ?
i did n't even get to eat .
we were very disappointed and will not be going back .
but not spectacular .
cashier was not friendly at all .
if yelp allowed no stars , that would be my rating for this motel .
my stay here was horrible .
the rooms were gross and the entire experience was uncomfortable .
i tried to contact corporate about it , but my concerns were ignored .
my stay was on feb _num_ , _num_ .
the receptionist was no help .
after trying several times , we requested a third room .
it was too late and we were tired so we just settled .
extremely disappointed .
i wish yelp allowed negative stars .
if i was n't so tired i would of headed someplace else !
i could n't get out of this hole fast enough !
the decor was bland , to say the least .
i had selected motel _num_ based on my experience in california .
anything else i 've tired here has been sub-par .
the mushrooms in our enchilada were canned , and then burned .
they tasted like kool-aid ( but without adequate water ) and lacked tequila .
pedro 's was , unfortunately , the first place that i tried .
the food is edible , but it is by no means mexican .
all their food is canned process nonsense .
does anyone in madison consider this a great mexican food location ?
friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas .
uh huh , that 's right , i said it .
that is , your cheesy , americanized mexican food experience .
i tried the vegetarian tamale and it was nothing less than awful .
no cheese anywhere , no flavor , just hot .
unfortunately on this particular visit we did n't get a hot waitress .
no sour cream on my burrito as ordered but we 'll move on .
i could n't even finish my meal it was so boring and tasteless .
tamales were not good .
when i said no , my satisfaction was not questioned .
the west side location was way better .
half the time i 'm there they screw up my order .
avoid this place .
server was really slow and did not seem to know the menu .
the dining area is extremely shabby : ripped cushions and dingy tables .
i do not know why i stayed after the first five minutes .
the food is microwaved and tastes like it came out of a box .
in short , the food left much to be desired .
warning : do not waste your money on this place !
terrible service !
absolute worst mexican food i have ever eaten , period .
it 's like mexican food for people who do n't like mexican food .
i would rather eat taco bell , and i do n't like taco bell .
i tried the camarones wrap - big mistake .
the shrimp were barely warm and slimy .
so try the table guac , but give the shrimp wrap a pass .
so like i say , good news , bad news .
the decor is _num_ 's `` americanized mexico . ''
unfortunately , the machine was n't running .
they had been sitting out for awhile .
that was a bit disappointing .
i had a burrito , it was ok .
nothing too exciting .
however , that probably is n't enough to bring me back again anytime soon .
badger game disappointment !
watered down drinks , slow service and rude management !
tonight was a completely different story !
my guinness tasted just like water , i suspect it was watered down .
our service was super slow .
we were there for over _num_ minutes before we received chips and salsa .
my cousin asked for sour cream and waited another _num_ minutes for it .
it needed spice though .
he clearly does n't care about his customers !
my fault for ordering mashed potatoes at a mexican restaurant .
bad service .
waiter was rude and obnoxious .
the chimichangas were on point though .
service was adequate , no more no less .
i will not go back .
sadly , the beer i was served was not moon man .
at one point , the bartender went from merely okay to completely unprofessional .
terrible customer service .
if you want decent mexican food , go elsewhere .
if you are craving a margarita , go elsewhere .
avoid .
i was here to watch the super bowl and the setup was not bad .
_num_ big tv 's to watch the game .
some free food and i believe they had $ _num_ pints .
then she never went out of her way .
ordered the fried ice-cream and it had no outer shell on it .
never did she ask not offer to fix it .
just look at facebook to find out they had a list of specials .
it 's not this place .
never going here again .
disappointment number one : the tortillas were dry and tasteless .
disappointment number two : the salsa was really sweet and thick .
it did n't taste fresh .
disappointment number three : the rice was so dry that it was almost crispy .
i was served a fried tortilla filled with plain shredded chicken and nothing else .
wo n't be coming back unfortunately .
oh and the tortillas and butter are n't free anymore , btw .
no more chances .
only reason for two stars due to extremely small portion .
ordered baked fish for $ _num_ .
smallest portion of fish i 've ever had at a fish fry .
but this time around , the food was a huge disappointment .
im guessing the dough was sitting out and getting old .
she was the only good thing about the whole experience .
again , no complaints for this arrangement .
the sauce was watery and had almost no flavor .
i 'm still thirsty just thinking about it .
the price is right - but i 'm just not into bland food .
meh , very mediocre food .
it had the consistency of paste and tasted horrible .
nothing surprising here .
the restaurant decor is out dated and worn out .
poor service below average breakfast and how do you even screw up breakfast .
food did not have quality flavor it was very bland .
the restroom was gross .
my breakfast was _num_ % correct .
as the yelp _num_ star rating says : meh .
waitress gives you wrong food then says you ordered wrong .
waitress tells me no , i ordered scrambled .
waitress comes back to tell me that i 'm wrong and walks away .
the coffee was pretty good and the service was decent if not overwhelming .
waitress gives you wrong food then says you ordered wrong .
i got some weird dish with hash browns in my pancakes and scrambled eggs .
i have never been treated so rudely by a server .
this place is awful .
i really hate the selection here and the prices are higher than other 's .
so i guess there 's that .
it had more salt than you 'd find in food at mcdonalds .
the meat in the pot roast tasted processed .
the dumplings were slimy .
the vegetables were so salty , they were inedible .
got _num_ slices of soggy french toast .
the egg was n't even cooked on it !
potatoes and grits were very bland .
food was horrible .
service was mediocre .
atmosphere was alright .
service was super slow even though half the tables were empty .
our food took about _num_ min and tasted like crap .
disgusting .
the broccoli was good at least and the only thing i actually ate .
i wo n't be going back .
come in here quite a bit by myself , usually later in the evenings .
the special french toast strawberry cream cheese special was terrible .
maybe _num_ half strawberries and a bland cream cheese mix on french toast .
was totally embarrassed because we told our friends what a great place this was .
not going back .
not always reliable .
i 'm so disappointed in union cab .
i almost missed my flight and will not be taking union cab again .
if i could give them _num_ reviews i would .
sorry that is not our problem .
so i expected a discounted price given the shared nature .
but no , i was still charged a flat rate of $ _num_ .
unfortunately , that ride was with union cab .
but then when _num_ minutes rolled around there was still no cab in sight .
i wish i 'd thought to get his cab number before leaving .
i wo n't make the mistake of using union cab again .
i am not impressed by their lack of concern for safety .
he constantly rolled his eyes and treated me as a stupid individual .
i would sooner walk everywhere then ever deal with this place again .
i wish they would be more consistent with their overall service .
first , the sandwich was exceptionally greasy .
second , the size of the burger was pathetic .
you 've got to be desperate to eat there .
i could n't even eat it .
it 's disappointing for the north side of town .
there are n't many options for `` fast '' food .
what a waste !
just like every other home depot .
do n't buy paint here , it 's really inconsistent .
wait no , here 's the deal .
i stayed here with my fiance for a night a couple of saturdays ago .
not a good thing .
the only reason i put one star is because i had to .
there were crumbs in the bed and they were n't very clean .
management was the worst of all .
so overall , easy to make a better choice anywhere else .
one push on my wheelchair and i was across the room .
not to worry .
so the highlight of the room comes when u r passed out and asleep .
going out to breakfast in the lobby is disgusting .
the exercise equipment did n't work properly .
the continental breakfast food did n't look good so i opted to eat elsewhere .
the cleaning staff kept leaving their cleaning supplies in my room .
as soon as we told the server what we wanted the service went downhill .
server said she needed my card and would have to talk to the manager .
nothing spectacular but then nothing terrible either .
the atmosphere is typical of the chain , and kept clean enough .
the only downside was the waiter .
huge mistake .
very expensive & the food is terrible .
we will not return to this chili 's location .
the `` bottomless '' salad never had an offer of a refill .
the server was nice but it was a disappointing meal .
also they have a horrible time having things in stock .
it 's my own fault for continuing to frequent this grocery store .
rarely are there any baskets for shoppers to use .
their is no mobile service so we can call home for last minute items .
the prepared food counter looks horrendous .
and they are frequently out of things they normally carry .
they 're terrible .
the produce section is the worst of the store .
something about this location just seems off .
my latest trip sealed the deal .
so , so long .
not okay .
pricey and bad quality service .
only one stylist working and no receptionist .
i went because i got a flat .
my boyfriend drops off my bike on a monday .
the also say they 're going to lube the brake lines .
he says that they seem to have totally forgotten about the bike .
my flat is fixed .
$ _num_ dollars .
there were no problems with the brakes when we gave the bike to them .
the guy running the show takes about _num_ seconds .
at this point , i am so angry i can barely see straight .
there 's nothing wrong with them .
wanted to support the neighborhood bike shop , but it was horrible experience .
hell , even santa shows up there now .
they ruin every , single trip to the mall .
not exactly an upscale mall by a long shot .
there are just no good stores there .
until then , there is no point in shopping here .
also , the food court sucks .
no good eatery places here at all .
just ... nothing .
hmm , this mall needs a facelift .
the stores are awful .
i do not even walk down certain area .
a pedi place and a foot massage place next door to one another ?
i just do not know what else to say .
not so much anymore .
sorry to say i wo n't support this mall any longer .
this time around was n't so great .
i could n't convince the owner of using dry cloths .
they have hardly any business - i wonder why ?
i do n't get my car cleaned ( inside ) on a regular basis .
it hardly looked like i just got my car cleaned .
will not be going here to throw away my money .
this place is the worst .
and the employees are rude .
i would not come back here if it was free .
`` ummmm , what kinds are there ? ''
then , you drive around , then , you pull up like normal .
awkward and offensive .
i pay my $ _num_ bucks , and go out to get my car .
i get in , and it looks like nothing was touched .
i just got this car _num_ weeks ago !
needless to say , i 'm really bummed and disgusted .
the employees are rude .
the product is over priced .
the people are rude !
no hello , no hi , how are you ?
but that is not a reason for employees to be rude to the customers .
the guys vacuuming out the cars got really rude with her .
the epitome of a crap chain .
why did i get talked into going here ?
this needs no explanation .
terrible !
wasted $ _num_ .
the sirloin was mostly fat and rubbery .
there was no meat to be eaten .
i really did not expect the food to be so bad .
the only good part was my daughter 's chicken fingers , fries and pepsi .
last time i went i was very disappointed in the service .
waiting for a table is common unless you go at really off peak times .
was offered something else , but the others i was with were already done .
did get a coupon for a return visit .
mozzarella sticks were barely warm .
the coleslaw served with it was literally inedible .
little to no dressing and tasteless .
i am not a fan of false advertisement !
i broke a rule : never eat at chain restaurants .
the minute i walked thru the door ... .
i do n't get it .
it 's not that hard to give a customer good service .
waited _num_ minutes , and no service .
we got up , walked out and nobody said a word or noticed .
i would avoid coming here .
this would n't even be one star for me .
no body came out so i went to the door and it was locked .
that was five minutes of trying to figure out where i can get in .
after i walk in , the bar area was filled , restaurant portion wasnt .
but that was n't the end of it .
i grabbed a piece of chicken out to try and it was completely cold !
the nachos were cold and soggy and the chicken was super cold .
i ate what i could then went to bed shortly after .
it was terrible .
my husband and i went in to attempt to have lunch .
when we entered they were not busy at all ... kind of dead really .
it was horrible from the get go .
it took our sever _num_ min before she even acknowledge our table .
and then she brought our salads and no silverware .
my wife had to get up and get some from the host .
my entree looked like it was under the heat lamp for _num_ min .
the course maintenance has really gone downhill over the last couple of years .
what a shame , because this course used to be a very nice facility .
the `` cart paths '' were awful !
if i could give less than one star , i would !
how are your employees not well trained enough to read a calendar ?
not just one but two employees .
restaurant manager said no problem .
manager gone - staff no clue we were coming .
it was $ _num_ for a bucket of balls .
dirty as all hell .
and yes someone can contact me if they 'd like .
i 've never been more dissatisfied with such customer service .
it was that bad .
not sure when or if i will go back .
this used to be a favorite .
very disappointed .
i wish they would go back to the old style of burgers .
one of the worse hotels i have stayed at in a long time .
this hotel is disgusting .
we should have spent more money and got a nicer place .
really disappointed .
this last stay of _num_ nights was a different story .
the first night we had loud and rude neighbors .
i will not be staying here again .
this hotel did not live up to even those minimal standards .
i was very disappointed in this hotel .
would not stay there again and would not recommend it to you .
no one cleaned our room .
however , my husband woke up with some kind of bug bites .
we wo n't be staying there again .
very cheap place ... in a bad way .
no conditioner , no lotion ... not impressed at all .
the bed was comfortable .
the sink allows plenty of room for toiletries .
ridiculous , i 'll take my tailoring needs elsewhere from now on .
if i could 've put zero stars , i would have .
it 's horrible .
let me wet it down . ''
she did , then she handed me my glasses and said , `` okay !
do not go to this place .
do n't lie to customers .
to begin with , they have only two chairs in the waiting area .
not good .
where i wanted it to go down , it goes up .
where i wanted it to go up , it goes down .
they do n't seem to blow dry after a standard haircut .
i paid $ _num_ for a manicure and it was not good .
nice employees , but it was definitely not worth the money .
i want to like this place but ca n't .
i went today and the did not have chicken .
i usually give people the benefit of the doubt but it was pretty bad .
this place has gone downhill .
the staff is slow and the orders are rarely correct .
they post hours til _num_ am on weekends but are rarely open past _num_ .
just go further down east wash if you need a crappy taco fix .
this used to be my favorite taco bell in the madison area .
if it happened to us twice , surely it 's happened to someone else .
gross !
i assume somebody got there late .
understaffed , slow , and disorganized .
there is another taco bell down east washington .
you 're better off going down the street .
after a _num_ minute wait , i inquired where my food was .
_num_ minutes later , still no food .
they lost my ticket again ?
the workers also gave me an extra fountain drink .
worst taco bell in the area .
honestly so annoying .
they mess up our order almost every time .
the lobster was not fresh , it was tough and very chewy .
my boyfriend and i visited for the first time ever on thursday .
however , our waiter was extremely rude .
i 'm assuming it was our age , but that should n't matter .
it made the entire experience quite disappointing .
even the salads are iffy .
their food is nothing special .
my last two visits there were very disappointing .
the food was bland .
that was frustrating .
the beer selection was very poor .
no local taps are offered .
the cheddar biscuits were heavily salted , almost to much to handle .
we had the crab linguine , and it to was overly salted .
the crab could n't even be tasted , as the salt overwhelmed everything .
all the food was terribly disappointing .
overall , this made for a rather miserable and expensive evening .
first and probably last time i dine at this red lobster location .
restaurant half empty and food took _num_ minutes .
came in at dinner time and it was quite busy .
why did it take _num_ minutes for our food to get there ?
even the cooks messed up the steak order at the table next to us .
i 'm giving a _num_ star rating because the service was ... awkward .
rather than get sick i pushed the plate away , barely touched .
the cheddar biscuits were way to salty and i love salt .
i 'll make that drive next time i need my lobster fix .
_num_ star for the salty biscuits is a 1/2 star too much .
they just ignored us so we said we would just go somewhere else !
i ate here with my wife recently .
so why not give it a shot .
surprisingly , we did n't have to wait long to get our seats .
i know the servers have to do it , but i found it annoying .
no big deal .
i told the server and he promptly brought out a different house salad .
my steak was rather bland .
when the bill came , it said waters w/ lemon .
everyone has off days , i get it .
a number of points during the experience rubbed me the wrong way .
service was slow .
my fries came out about _num_ minutes after my entree did .
the shrimp was over battered and the fries were over cooked .
i would n't eat here again .
oh dear , you guys ... .
block is just awful !
horrible in fact !
so very , very bad !
i wo n't be back .
but for us , it was a complete and utter disaster .
we were wrong !
we went around _num_ and waited _num_ min or so for a table .
we could have walked out ... and almost did without paying .
no carry out on friday nights !
our food was just so ... terrible .
plus , they did n't even provide a leaf of lettuce or tomato .
i do n't care how good the food is or the beer selection .
not going back .
went for lunch had the fish fry .
really bad over cooked just bad .
i so wanted to like this place .
no drink menu on the table and the server did n't mention a thing .
the italian beef was very dry almost jerky .
pros : the beer , casual atmosphere , and garlic chile fries .
cons : confused servers , bad burger buns , smokers on the patio .
my husband 's walleye was not so excellent .
so not a good first experience .
i schedule a _num_ hr appt .
my oil change took over _num_ minutes .
why should i wait _num_ minutes on a routine oil change ?
there was nothing unusual about my car or the service i was requesting .
i am unimpressed , and found the customer service unacceptable .
they didnt bother to apologize or give any explanation either .
there are much better and cheaper places to get your oil changed in madison .
i love noodles but this location is going downhill fast .
is there a broccoli shortage ?
i got _num_ thinly sliced pieces .
maybe _num_ sticks .
there is no shortage for noodles though .
such a contrast to the sleeping counter person .
no one jumped on to help him out .
i really miss the west side location , they were on top of it .
in the past _num_ weeks i have been here _num_ times .
the food has been very below this company 's standards .
he was n't doing anything and it was not busy by any means .
i was the only person standing there waiting for my food .
there were several other employees that looked at the bag and said nothing .
terrible customer service !
we will not be back !
the place is run down and the machines are old .
i will never be going back .
i freaked out , grabbed my wet clothes , and ran out of there .
when i got home i realized i 'd left clothes in another dryer .
completely scary , awful experience .
mind you , it was 4:30 p.m. on a monday .
i asked what time they close tomorrow , he said , `` 8:30 '' .
`` no , we 've got to go . ''
he offered no explanation , and i did n't bother to ask why .
before leaving , i checked their website .
do n't say you are returning a gift .
hey east side , get a clue .
only wish i could give them _num_ stars .
significantly peeling off the walls .
i could go on , but i 'm sure you get the point .
get your wallet out !
i buy a room for a night and a conference room for a day .
this hotel really sticks it to their priceline customers .
just stayed here for one night and it was passable .
it 's just a bit dated and tired looking .
but charge me twice before i even attempted to check out ?
gross hotel !
nasty carpeting .
very old furniture .
horrible experience .
upper management should be ashamed to have not upgraded the rooms years ago .
she replied that she would call downstairs to send someone up .
there are six pieces of fruit put out on the front desk each morning .
you 've been warned .
the air handling is so terrible , i truly can not warn you enough .
i am not able to hold my breath long enough to tolerate the stench .
used hotwire to find a last minute deal when traveling through madison .
the room was pretty rough .
the light over the mirror did n't work .
things were just worn out .
the bed had clearly seen better days .
the room had big stains on carpet .
the free wifi was completely unreliable and cut off every five to seven minutes .
the tub drain did not work and could n't be a new issue .
stay elsewhere if you have a choice .
simply awful .
old , needs remodeling .
air did n't work correctly in the bedroom area .
really disappointed .
apparently ac only works if light is on and you move around .
ancient stained plastic toilet seat .
coffee at the breakfast buffet tastes like it was out of said toilet .
i stayed here hoping for something better than the motel _num_ down the road .
did n't get it .
wish i had checked yelp before coming .
horrible service .
nearly _num_ minutes later our drinks showed up .
at $ _num_ for a taco , the price was awesome .
this place was gross and depressing .
we live nearby , but i will avoid ever going back .
some of staff good others could care less .
but as you may know , bigger is not necessarily better .
these burgers are n't seasoned and are quite bland .
a little salt and pepper would help a lot .
they were chewy and gross .
the burger buns were n't so much toasted as burnt .
all _num_ of us were pretty underwhelmed .
the bar itself is a pretty typical wisconsin dive bar .
there were only a few others in there around _num_ pm on a sunday .
tell me what i need , tell me how to care for things .
they should n't even allow carts throughout because it 's too cramped .
the disease spread to other pepper plants that i purchased from elsewhere .
service was atrocious .
another _num_ before our orders were taken and drinks brought .
not cool .
two adults and one kid equals a _num_ dollar meal .
it 's not like we ordered everything on the menu either .
the service was horrible .
the bathrooms were nasty dirty , next time i 'll just hold it .
out of a can , bag , box , or freezer .
parking is very limited .
not a fan .
this is probably the worst ihop i have ever been to in my life .
i 'd rather cook my own breakfast than eat here .
i was seated and given a menu , and that is where it ended .
cause she saw the mean looks on our faces .
the manager should be fired as well as the entire staff .
only 2-3 tables were being used .
part of my omelette was cold when i received it .
this place is dirty , and disgusting .
food is poor quality .
service is terrible !
if i could give negative stars i would !
horrible service !
the two guys working there are so rude .
internet sucks which is why i wo n't be back .
service was ok , wireless internet is unreliable .
by far the worst place i stayed when i drove across the country .
it was not cheap and the room was gross .
the bed was the worst thing i have ever slept on .
i did not feel safe here .
would not come back here .
if you have a pet , go stay at a super _num_ .
far past the expiration date ; _num_ .
poor quality ; _num_ .
stale .
almost a full month past expiration !
fortunately , we did n't eat the hummus .
unfortunately , we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner .
it 's incredibly disappointing too , when you 're looking forward to good bread .
then there 's the deli , where there 's been a few issues .
it was slimy , chewy , tough , flavorless , & ultimately inedible .
this particular deli meat however , was a few steps beyond .
however , he did so without gloves & without washing his hands .
service ... not so good .
food ... not so good .
they also had a salad bar that accompanied the fish fry .
horrible service in the bar .
rude and inattentive bartenders even though it was n't busy .
the service we got was the worst we both have ever experienced .
which is unfortunate because the fish was actually decent .
food was average , service terrible , drinks flat .
this week was a disaster .
salad lettuce was limp and sitting out way too long .
waitress nowhere to be found .
waitress was clueless .
_num_ tries and still ca n't get a simple pizza order right !
hold the phone , this is n't what i ordered .
i dunno if i was expecting too much but this certainly did not deliver .
first and foremost , she is not friendly at all .
she made me feel rushed and took away from the moment .
unfortunately , it did n't fit properly .
zero customer appreciation !
she 's the professional that was hired because she said she could do it .
the end result , the dress was too tight .
never will i go there again , or would i recommend her services !
stopped in because i was nearby and did a search for close coffee shops .
looked like a cool place , however the service was pretty poor .
i will never be back .
this place it not worth the reputation .
somebody teach these people some customer service .
i am consistently disappointed when i visit monty 's .
a companion ordered a plain cheeseburger and it was loaded with onions .
another companion got the german chocolate cake which was also dry .
cooking school _num_ will tell you the bun will fall apart .
i 'm not terribly impressed with it .
i could probably get better breakfast somewhere else .
its not amazing food .
is it just me or is it always cold in there ?
gross , disgusting , rip-off .
i have no reason to set foot in this place .
but the food quality is generally average to poor .
do n't waste the time or money , many better options around town .
it completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back .
not to mention that the food is always mediocre .
not happy and not coming back .
wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it .
the food that we got was not that great this time anyway .
the host at the counter was not friendly .
gross .
nothing special , just some plain old ice cream and say , caramel .
milk , ice cream , caramel ?
just checking ... smh ... whoa , what ?
wait ... did they just charge me like that much for this ?
i do n't even know why people like this place .
i do n't understand why this place is popular .
the food was bad and the service was bad .
my friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible .
no one was unfriendly , just incompetent .
there 's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city .
never going back , and i think the food has made me ill .
some ok food , some terrible .
recently it has been just ok .
everything about this place was mediocre .
the food was mediocre , the ambiance was mediocre and the service was mediocre .
i would not call it special or extraordinary , but it is not bad .
the service is less than desirable .
last friday i went there for another shake and it was really thin .
$ _num_ is way too much for a watery shake .
while waiting i had to use the restroom -- disgusting .
when we finally got a table , service was rushed and impersonal .
it seemed totally chaotic and like nobody was in charge .
lunch was okay , but nothing special .
will not be back .
the host was friendly and despite being busy , they sat us quickly .
i ordered chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes .
both of which were really dry .
eggs where overlooked .
drinks sat empty most of our visit .
it 's all fine , but not special at all .
_num_ mins later and we were finally seated .
unbelievably bad service and only a weak apology are n't going to cut it .
my friend had the zucchini potatoes pancakes which were incredible .
every time i go there it 's just so mediocre .
i do n't know what anyone likes about this place .
that 's not what i want to pay for .
what really went wrong was when i ordered the vegan sweet potato hash .
she took the plate away but offered no real apology for the mistake .
however she still charged me for my coffee ... .
wow , _num_ stars ?
but my room smelled like stale smoke and the desk was really small .
front desk was rude and not helpful whatsoever .
it 's filthy ... do n't sit on anything .
terrible service .
actually no service .
it was nearly empty ... easy to see why .
this place is just dirty .
for every positive interaction i have , i have two negatives ones .
the salesperson said i could pick from any four .
it was weird .
nothing happened to it .
the lady at the counter was so rude .
we did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system .
but she needed a person from paint to approve it .
no one asked us anything .
it was ridiculous .
the garden department is rather large as is my list .
hey , i get it .
stopped in here after breakfast at denny 's next door .
walked through the store to the service desk .
as everyone in madison knows , there are no doughnut chain stores around .
no krispy kreme .
no dunkin donuts .
yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open until _num_ pm .
lights were out , nobody home .
i ordered the spinach with rice dish , and my husband got the gyro .
i could n't even stomach a few bites .
the gyro was a gyro , nothing great , nothing terrible .
such a disappointment .
very bland & the crust ... just no .
the teenagers even thought it was mediocre .
i have a coupon for free _num_ inch pizza when purchasing _num_ inch pizza .
boo shame on them .
i ordered a stuffed ( pie ) pizza for carryout .
while having a slice i found out that it was not even cooked completely .
at that point they lost me and it only got worse .
i know for a fact that this was not true .
he was even rude with his staff while we were there .
not a fan .
big mistake .
very messy and started to come off very quickly .
poor hours , selection and service .
just there 's not a lot of variety or selection .
i swear i 've never left this place not feeling awful .
the place reeked of old urine .
they would n't even refund our money for the fish we had bought .
she never gave advice as to why or what else can be done .
i would n't even put a star .
maybe they should teach their employees what they r talking about !
no way am i going back to them !
ur losing customers !
do the employee 's working here know how to stock the shelves ?
not everyone has a _num_ lb dog .
i 'm not even asking much .
however , the kitty was asleep so we were unable to see her personality .
such obvious bs .
, then told i could chose from the board .
but this has been my experience .
also , the food was a big disappointment .
ever since caf royale took over the scene , the coffee is not fantastic .
i do n't come here anymore - bad vibes .
friend said that it is not her experience ... maybe a bad make .
not impressed .
we have had a terrible customer service experience with this place .
horrible service .
unacceptable .
unless , you want to have terrible service and regret about your money .
can not believe it !
this place is horrible for service .
another week went by and we heard nothing .
we finally talked to him and he said there was no gas leak .
the motor had a leak and was covered under warranty .
look at all the bad reviews for this place .
i looked around and my boat was nowhere to be found .
i 've been sitting here for and hour and a half now and nothing .
absolute worst dry cleaners in madison .
i have had to return multiple shirts because they were not cleaned properly .
the new ownership has completely ruined that experience .
they have destroyed multiple shirts and the service is poor .
the new management is awful .
the turn around time is brutal and the customer service is even worse .
i would not recommend .
full of gristle , did n't taste good , etc .
when i complained to the owner , there was never a response .
aside from the johnny d 's the others all serve incredibly bad food .
terrible service .
i highly recommend not going here .
im still not sure i 'll go back .
i recently had my engagement pictures here .
ok still , we can hurry .
my fianc did not bc he did not feel comfortable .
and my photographer stayed to take pics with my ring .
i 've never been treated so terribly .
part of me really never wants to go back there ever again .
she needs a crash course on customer service .
bc she has zero .
she basically told us , `` no , '' _num_ different ways .
you end up with a slide off mess .
grease running down my hand .
sorry , pizza pit staff .
[ cue the tim & eric `` ya blew it ! ''
big mistake !
that was n't much better .
all in all , i will never return for a fish fry there .
i was utterly wrong .
i thought my cod was adequate but rather tasteless and in need at salt .
it tasted fishy and disgusting !
but , i 'll never be eating here again .
this place has really gone downhill .
fish fry was over cooked and greasy .
i really do n't see any greatness there .
not a fan .
have not had lunch or dinner here .
my wife and ate there tonight .
service not good .
wish i was told they did have lake perch .
after dinner drinks at the bar did n't go so well .
what a disappointment !
took forever to get seated , took even longer to get waited on .
the table was not completely cleared nor reset when we were seated .
the fish was n't much better , definitely not what we had hoped for .
salty , doughy breadsticks .
eggplant parmesan , greasy , boring cheese .
the red sauce , peppery but no substantial flavor .
chicken parmesan .
no , we are n't in italy .
i left full , but i can get full at mcdonald 's too .
americans do n't know the difference any more .
if i could not give any stars i would .
she only knew i couldnt do a saturday evening .
our main complaint was that it was hot in the restaurant .
we were tired and somewhat sad and looking forward to a nice dinner .
it did n't start well .
he just crowded the plates onto the table while we scrambled to make room .
i tasted it , and yup , tasted just like it looked .
i guess we 'll skip olive garden next time !
the soups were not as good either .
i have never had a bad experience with the food here .
instead we have _num_ awful ones and three mediocre .
i do not recommend this place .
they are charging for hot tea and pepper oil .
they have better service and half lower price for the better food .
i would not eat there again .
no fortune in the fortune cookie !
second bite into my chicken , and it 's hard .
no fortune .
disappointment .
the chicken was bad quality , i 've had much better .
prices were n't bad either .
i will not go to the restaurant again even in my dreams .
awful dirty place .
prices too high and service very slow .
save yourself lots of money and frustration and avoid this location .
went here today for a flat tire patch .
never again , goodyear !
terrible service .
he said they left the most worn tire up front with the new one .
do n't count on the people in this store to give you complete information .
the staff did not even attempt to address my needs .
i wish i could remember this one 's name .
i went back the next day and was served by rebecca .
she was unfriendly and never smiled !
i was very disappointed at the service i got here .
my iphone is _num_ 1/2 years old and was turning off on me constantly .
i did n't drop it and never had problems before .
the worst cell phone experience of my life .
the sound was terrible and i spent more time outside than in .
mr. roberts has going for it .
drinks are reasonably priced too .
worst worst worst !
i got the pathetic haircut ever .
i felt so embarrassed .
most awful and horrible place to get a haircut .
quit going there .
i needed a quick haircut , so was pretty much forced to go here .
and this lady was rough .
i would not recommend going here .
the price is n't even right , at $ _num_ .
nobody even bothered to ask me if i was waiting for my appointment .
our bill was completely off .
however , we only got a refill on the water when the check came .
if this is a concern for you , consider a different restaurant .
starters were about $ _num_ and entrees were less than $ _num_ .
but , i would not come back for dinner .
the food was fair to poor , and the dog issue is unappetizing .
no longer dog friendly .
too bad for them !
i live _num_ blocks from the tip top .
cash only really sucks .
one of the worst kfc 's i have ever eaten at !
everything was dry .
the potatoes were watery , butter was rock hard .
avoid kfc at all costs !
the food quality is continuously horrible .
when i called and asked to speak to a manager no one spoke english .
i ca n't believe this place is still in business .
it 's always dead , like a ghost town .
i do n't recommend going around the dinner hour for sure .
you 've been warned .
beer selection is ok.
i was of age but not planning on drinking .
_num_ thumbs down .
extremely slow drink service .
each drink took about _num_ minutes to get to the table .
and i 'm not twelve .
portion was fine for the price , but was the salad ever bland .
three tiny croutons on top and flavorless cheese .
i wo n't be going back .
the sides were not good at all .
drinks way over priced !
it was shady business .
there was a better way to express their concerns , if they were legitimate .
turns out they would have charged me less for my breaks .
( that almost never happens ) just be careful and shop around .
where was the call before i dropped of as promised !
waste of my time .
left the car for them to check things out .
still i am not going back somewhere that pretty much almost threatened my life .
customer service is second to none .
yes this place is highly recommended for those looking for crap dentistry .
my consultant was ok , but not overly helpful .
and there has n't been much info .
still no idea when these blinds will arrive .
after initial order and down payment i never heard back from them .
communication was poor .
never had any kind of follow up call to see whether we were happy .
wo n't recommend and wo n't use them again .
ordering over the phone , everything seemed to go well .
she refunds me around _num_ bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge .
so i come back and begin with the ribs , 1/2 a slab .
from the first taste i was not impressed .
the fries dipped in the bbq sauce were the best part by far .
and i ordered fries and mashed potatoes , neither of which was included .
so the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect .
and note , the chicken was not anything to write home about either .
was driving by madison and thought we 'd get some bbq .
that was it , not even a big chicken breast ?
it looked like it was from a grocery store .
i waited _num_ minutes .
i did n't have anymore time and asked them to check my order .
nope , the ticket was lost .
i was so hungry and so sad that i could n't get any ribs .
but at least i know she put my ticket into the kitchen .
unfortunately , i was disappointed .
the salad was just bagged romaine lettuce with dressing in a packet .
nothing could be farther from the truth !
really bad service worst attitude i 've seen .
and then again for game _num_ of the world series .
here 's what 's not : extremely inconsistent ribs .
why ca n't i get them on my dinner ?
the service has n't gotten any better here .
do n't go here if you do n't want to be threatened by him .
did n't want _num_ plates or anything else .
the ribs were very dry and the sides were very small .
you will not get great value here .
we did find parking on a side street , but not real convenient .
the friendly service is probably not enough to get us back for another visit .
the ribs are over cooked .
if you like bbq sauce , then this may be your spot .
i 'm still searching for good bbq meat in madison .
very frustrating experience .
our order was very simple but the cashier could n't get it right .
every customer had a problem with their food or order .
never again ... .
mediocre , really .
giving two stars only because the food was mediocre .
horrible customer service !
this time it was awful .
not going back .
the noodles were a bit dried out but the sauce was super yummy .
i 'll try again , but will more than likely dine-in and not drive-thru .
no way .
overall , this store is disappointing .
we have been buying our dog food from here for years .
they will no longer have my family 's business .
worst place ever !
my oldest died so i wanted to buy a kitten there .
they act like your stupid and know nothing about cats .
i told them i would n't come back and the could care less .
having said all this , my opinion of this store changed as of today .
i went into their store to get some dog food .
the groomer was not friendly at all .
she was n't too happy i had to go back to the grooming area .
i asked how long as my husband was picking her up .
never again will i visit this store .
my previous review was for an oil change , which i still stand by .
brought it by that morning and explained the brake problem i was experiencing .
got a call back with a $ _num_ estimate .
i just need a quote because i am shopping around .
this place is horrible .
they ripped me off so bad on an oil change and filter service .
the gyro meat was bland ... gyros are not meant to be bland !
if you want spinach pie , go to med cafe .
we had coffee , the sausage skillet , and the southern benedict .
all was edible , but nothing out of the common way .
food was terrible .
nothing was fresh , all processed or frozen .
service was n't the worst , but also not even as good as mediocre .
i will not be coming back .
they have an acoustics problem here .
it 's horribly loud in there , and everything feels rushed and crushed together .
clearly i was not the only one with this impression .
what i do not expect is to be treated rudely .
i later called panera and spoke with the manager dennis .
consider yourself warned .
this location needs new management and new employees .
always slow service .
staff never in a hurry .
nothing special to write about .
service just so so , food just ok and wifi horrible .
would not return to this one .
could n't even wait to get out of the restaurant to write this review .
update : finally got the smoothie _num_ minutes after we finished eating .
my order was about _num_ mins apart .
wait times for food have just gotten terrible .
once my go to lunch spot stinks for service .
someone in management needs to get a clue !
associate was helpful .
the rest of the experience , not so much .
the chair still has problems .
there was never any follow up from the madison store .
this purchase has turned in to an unfortunate experience .
the survey is time sensitive and we were unable to comment .
this purchase has turned in to an unfortunate experience .
the survey is time sensitive and we were unable to comment .
well , it has n't gotten any better .
there was a big saturday sale going on .
i was quoted $ _num_ for the chair .
they quoted the exact chair for $ _num_ .
i booked everything online and called to confirm .
i was told it was a _num_ % deposit .
next month i will be renting from any other company besides enterprise .
i landed less than _num_ minutes early and went to get my rental .
she offered no options -- -- no taxi service , etc .
awful does not begin to describe tonight 's experience .
wow - quite the rude encounter at enterprise rental at madison airport .
the place is not that bad , shoes seem a bit old but passable .
we had a very bad customer service experience .
this is unfortunate .
if i could select zero i would have .
nothing wrong with the bowling alley , the staff just sucks .
the staff are extremely rude and not very accommodating .
it kind of explains why nobody comes here .
the worst customer service i have ever experienced .
will never be going back to this place again .
worst service ever .
i want to give this dump a big fat _num_ .
the menu was extremely old , small and the coffee was pure water .
i order the walleye , hash browns , toast and eggs breakfast .
biscuit , gravy and hash browns ?
not only that but the server was horrible .
i felt like she ignored my mother and i the entire time .
she was a horrible waitress .
neither my mother or i could finish our food .
i took possibly _num_ bites and was done .
i told the cashier the food was horrible and i would n't be back .
you do no throw your co workers under the bus to customers !
just a horrible business , not friendly and food is beyond pathetic .
my car was no completed on time .
east side never fixed the problem but they were glad to keep my money .
all of the food is greasy , bland , and expensive .
i was there on a hot sat in june .
should n't the outside order window be opened .
if use a credit card you pay _num_ % more .
what a rude and disappointing experience .
the custard is ok , but nothing special .
for all the hype , michael 's is quite a disappointment .
that is ridiculous .
it was slow , disorganized , and not very friendly .
one of them just disappeared into a back room .
served with about _num_ french fries .
are you kidding me ?
$ _num_ for a milkshake ?
not to mention it was not much of a milkshake .
it was not very impressive whatsoever .
the hot dog was hot and the chili was warm .
i like that they have shredded cheese on it , rather than liquid cheese .
_num_ - my dining companion got a burger .
it tasted ok , but it was a very thing patty .
he also ordered cheese curds with it .
they were so greasy and lacked any good flavor in the breading .
not good .
not even worth the price !
did n't michael 's used to be good ?
to say i 'm disappointed is an understatement .
that should have been my first warning .
the bacon was okay , but there was n't enough of it .
the cheese was some processed crap .
the fries were equally frozen pieces of bland , tasteless crap .
i hate to make a fuss , so i did n't .
unless something changes , i think i 'm done with michael 's .
disturbing to say the least .
so far this company has been very disappointing .
it was supposed to be delivered on tuesday .
it was not .
it was not delivered on wednesday .
this is a terrible company .
if i could give negative stars i would .
this is an illegal and unethical business practice !
if i could give negative stars i would .
deserves zero stars .
worst customer service .
customer service is awful .
i 'm not even sure where to begin .
that quickly turned into an hour and a half .
the staff was really chaotic and unorganized .
there was literally almost no fish .
literally these are the words we just exchanged after getting home .
terrible .
no , the `` wedge '' was lettuce , carrots and bacon .
only gave them one star because zero was n't an option !
i had a very unpleasant experience with the owner of this business today .
when we got there nobody was there .
no phone call , no e-mail , nothing .
extremely disappointed .
not tonight .
for tonight , the feast of the dollars is upon us .
i asked again , and he had to go get his manager ?
the shelves were not stocked and there was stuff everywhere .
i was looking for a bath mat , a fan and some groceries .
the lighting was dim and very difficult to find what i needed .
there were employees walking around but no one was putting things on shelves .
the produce department was disgusting - moldy food , smelly .
i could n't believe it .
very disappointed .
i am a frequent walmart shopper .
they are completely inefficient , slow , lazy , and rude .
she was , just as the previous clerk , extremely slow and uncaring .
it took forever to get my stuff and get out of there .
however , the layout and design should have probably stayed in the _num_ 's .
was sent by one walmart to this walmart for the last of a product .
i grab another employee .
who spent _num_ minutes in the back searching for the wrong product !
this is a ridiculous game of cat and mouse and i 'm really unimpressed .
the money just seems to be needed to drive business i guess .
you will find better business elsewhere .
ordering the tires was ok .
after _num_ minutes , he said he was done .
unfortunately , my experience with this store did not end that day .
while filling it up , i could hear the air leaking out slowly .
firestone called tires plus and told them what happened .
one was horrible and one provided great customer service .
i had my oil changed here a few times and will never go again .
i was afraid because i didnt know what was wrong .
i 've been using priceline for _num_ years almost on a weekly basis .
my room is next to the elevator too .
this was neither .
really disappointed .
i walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed .
the guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me !
it was clear that i was next , but he did n't serve me .
i patiently waiting thinking something was strange .
he then asked me what i needed .
i explained and we walked to the pump .
he just left me standing there .
i walked back in the shop wondering what was going on .
he thanked me for my patience and went along .
... and he walked back in the store , leaving me by myself .
i 'm serious , i stood there shocked and wondering what was happening .
i did n't deserve service like this .
he did n't need to treat me with such disregard .
they do n't deserve your money .
stay away and tell your friends to not support this shop .
now , it 's all horrible .
cheese sticks were under cooked , the pizza was extremely greasy .
i mean , oil was literally dripping out of the crust .
gross .
first time great and reasonably priced for fries , boneless buffalo wings and dips .
no , really .
you 're kind of a disaster sometimes , man .
but just ... just get it together , dude .
do i need an artisan barbecue glaze on my crust ?
be greasy and awful and ridiculous , pizza hut .
when he explained his diagnosis he raised his voice at me for no reason .
that was enough for me to look elsewhere for auto repair .
julie was the consultant who helped me .
i then signed and returned with a _num_ % down payment .
what a customer service disaster .
avoid this place like the plague .
not cool .
clearly this company does n't work well with others .
dirty counters , messy machines , and dirty tables .
who knew you could mess up a blizzard so bad ?
no card , no money left their hand .
they are like , it is just brownies .
he ordered a turtle pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard .
when i asked for one , they said they did not have any .
more like gross .
and just walked away .
besides the poor service , the food standards were disgusting .
they get a negative star !
this dq does not even deserve _num_ star .
no follow up .
gross .
they were out of pie pieces , okay fine .
tried it , it was discussing .
waste of $ _num_ .
by the looks of the other reviews the owner does n't give a crap .
this place was a waste of our time and money .
and the trainer seemed nice but did a crappy job at training .
seriously will never go back to this place .
please people do n't waste your time or money here !
absolutely the slowest service ever !
waited _num_ minutes for _num_ ice cream treats , extremely disappointed .
however it is always a hit or miss .
today was the worst pizza i have ever had .
my husbands also was just as bad .
did n't honor online prices from their own website .
the kid at the counter was clueless .
not pink or even a smoke ring , blood .
not cool .
they were busy ( which is great ) but they could not handle it .
ate here last night .
food was barely tolerable and the place was so dirty .
never going back .
this place is in need of some serious updating in all areas .
the inside of the restaurant was unclean and tacky .
neither my dad nor i were impressed with the food .
this is not a good thing .
not a lot of great variety .
i had the 1/2 rack of ribs with slaw and fries .
the slaw and fries were fine .
nothing special but not bad .
the ribs , on the other hand , could use some work .
sauce should provide an accent to good bbq , not be the bbq .
one rib was fall of bone .
further down , it was closer to jerky .
all in all , not a great bbq experience .
barely ok.
service was flat out terrible .
not even close to the best in madison .
the ribs were very dry and tough .
will not be going back .
it used to my favorite place for barbecue .
the cook said that happens sometimes and sent out two cold pieces of rib .
i tried a chicken leg first and all i could taste was smoke .
the breast was dry .
next i tried the ribs .
they were tender , but for some reason they tasted like sausage .
the baked beans were pretty good .
the coleslaw is what hurt .
bottom line is i 've had better bbq in the madison area .
we decided on the tuesday special - all you can eat chicken and ribs .
what a disappointment .
i would not recommend fat jacks .
service was 3-4 stars but food was a _num_ stars .
however the the fried mushrooms were good .
i wo n't be back .
better service , friendlier doctors , the list goes on .
most likely between _num_ and _num_ stars .
on an early saturday evening , i walked in to an empty restaurant .
my quesadilla was a bean taco , yup definitely not a quesadilla .
i ordered a burrito with chorizo and it was very bland .
it 's very greasy and runny and even the sour cream is like liquid .
food did n't look fresh and was pretty flavorless .
the refried beans look like they have an artificial light purple color to them .
service was slow and unprofessional .
spend your money in a local hardware store .
the inside is huge , but arranged poorly .
the new checkout lines are set up in a really dumb way .
it was an awkward exchange given he did n't say anything .
so bizarre !
i was probably wrong about the latter part .
he told me that 's not how it works .
again , this is apparently not how it works .
farm and fleet or fleet farm is my only go to now !
worst customer service ever !
_num_ minutes before closing .
employees avoid you instead of helping you find what you are looking for .
i then waited another _num_ minutes for my drink .
this is the 2nd time i 've been disappointed by this site .
poor management and training of staff is very evident .
horrible .
one of the worst starbucks i have ever been to .
bathrooms messy without toilet paper men 's restroom .
worst starbucks experience .
avoid this one at all costs .
big store , lots of seating and staff , filthy .
i really hate stores , especially that serve food , that are filthy .
at the moment i 'm especially pissed , because they killed my car .
the cable never connected well , as if they did n't test it .
i called to have the repair , no follow up .
( not cheaper ) .
hell no ... they eat mostly meat and some veggies .
even if it appears to be absurd , like a sunday paper .
i really do n't understand why anyone would go here .
wrong !
it 's all garbage .
the only semi good brand is sassy cow and again , guess what ?
more than six dollars per container !
the bakery section is gross , too .
your bakery department sucks big time .
you charge ridiculous prices on your desserts that are made just not right .
no worries many options to choose from near by .
they scream about being local but they really dont partner with local businesses .
i just wonder how often this happens .
and be sure to check the prices at the register !
oh yea they did disgusting !
if i had to eat that meat i would rather stare to death !
horrid meat !
not only that , but the store is over-priced and not well laid out .
the worst arby 's i have ever eaten at .
so , here is why it is bad .
_num_ ) the portions are small on every sandwich that we ordered .
_num_ ) they say they do n't have any monthly deals .
_num_ ) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order .
this place is pretty gross .
have some standards , arby 's .
horrible service .
false advertising .
however , it took _num_ minutes to get our food .
_num_ minutes we sat there and waited .
i know that french fries are not usually made in individual orders .
ridiculous .
visited for the first time on friday , july _num_ .
wow , what a disappointment .
steak sandwiches are supposed to be lean !
disgusting .
i was n't expecting philly quality , but this was gross .
bad service and unfriendly staff .
everyone looks like working there has made them bitter , fat and angry .
the food is not good ; never order the fries !
the crowd there is so-so at best , usually on the trashy side .
horrible service !
we refuse to spend our money at an establishment like this .
its no wonder the parking lot was pretty much empty !
i was excited to work with carl at my tasting .
i had some issues finding the place and traffic was bad .
i called a few days later to reschedule and left a message .
several days passed with no response .
i was left feeling he was very stuck up and unprofessional .
what a waste of time .
disappointing cakes .
fake rum , maybe ?
i really think people buy these cakes because they do n't know any better .
carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design .
the kitchen room itself smelled like butter with the cake sitting in the room .
it was totally disgusting .
so carl , just a word of advice .
it 's okay , i guess .
lousy grocery and produce , but excellent doughnuts .
they have minimal selection and the prices are nothing to get excited about .
therefore , i end up there for groceries more often than not .
i have tried a few places with no luck .
so rather than waste gas money , i began calling around .
the phone was answered and i simply asked : do you carry time magazine ?
no good bye .
if she was busy she could have said that .
she says she does not know .
that is my whole experience trying to find a magazine .
i walked out feeling completely terrible .
i will not go to your store .
however , do not get your nails done here .
its decor is horrible .
it 's pricing itself out of madison .
this is not a great first impression .
this place as reopened and should have stayed closed .
literally the worst hair experience of my entire life .
the other _num_ stations were dusty .
no one or nothing was in the manicure area .
it looked like a ghost town .
the entire experience was uncomfortable .
that 's not what i 'm paying $ _num_ for .
they gave me a discount price of $ _num_ .
i did n't realize the place shut down .
the ultimate now is not the ultimate it was years ago .
it 's horrible and i strongly advise against going there .
extremely disappointing first time visit .
thank you for wasting my time today .
at $ _num_ it was definitely not a good value .
this place is for lack of a better word , simply the worst !
i ordered the fish basket , which for wisconsin should never be bad .
i was wrong .
i was very wrong !
okay , then let me do it now : the food was cold !
i would never go to this place again .
they were not exciting .
i do n't see myself ever wanting to come back for dinner .
when we got our drinks , they were weak !
that waitress needs _num_ things : some training and an order pad .
awful service , rude bartenders .
i tip well but yeah ... they might get a penny .
service sucked .
he was not at all apologetic .
this is terrible customer service .
i am looking elsewhere .
i do n't know where their beef is from .
they really deserve a _num_ so i rounded down .
the owner responded to my request with a simple `` no . ''
not a true butcher either .
this kfc never has the chicken you want ready .
the staff and customers are awful .
this place can not ever give me everything i order .
lame .
the service was slow .
when i got home , the food was poor quality .
the mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy .
even the coleslaw was very dry .
some of the staff barely knows english past the menu items and prices .
i really wish i had read the reviews before i came here .
a chain restaurant i thought ; how bad could it be ... ?
unfortunately , there was a big language barrier .
what bothered me was a listed dish at $ _num_ was $ _num_ !
potato wedges : awful .
zero stars .
this particular bucks seems to be hit or miss .
the crust is incredibly thin .
their sizes are not generously portioned out .
i want to like them more , but they are just sub-par .
nothing stood out to me .
i appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags .
unfortunately , i will not be back again .
not understanding the good reviews here .
their pizza is gross .
with so many choices , i simply ca n't consider this one again .
ate here twice .
thought it was dirty and did n't find the food very good at all .
after that though , i was n't very impressed .
curry was bland and lacked spice and punch .
ca n't really mess up the rice so no complaints .
plantains were a little soggy and lacked crisp .
food was ok , place was dingy , and the staff was very rude .
avoid i would give zero stars if i could .
uninspired chinese food from very nice people .
maybe that 's why i only had three bites .
quoted _num_ minutes , was here in _num_ .
the lo mien was also horrible .
there saving grace is their hot sour soup .
but in all honestly , nothing special .
this is not the place i recommend .
normally i think crappy chinese food is good .
still eating , but this is really disappointing so i 'm typing this now .
the general tso 's is terrible like the others say .
there 's just no flavor .
the shrimp is n't very good , but not as bad as the chicken .
the crab rangoon is terrible .
hell , asian kitchen is better than this place .
they told me that would be _num_ each .
i wo n't be ordering again .
how about you do n't nickel and dime your customers .
horrible .
i 'm not _num_ percent sure .
i 've been down south and had amazing sausage gravy .
if i want that crap , i 'll stay home and cook it myself .
i 'm not going back .
bad service and even worse `` food . ''
they get _num_ star because of all the adorable old people there .
i get it , it is small , simple , nothing special .
however , the place is not awful .
it is just your local breakfast place with food options under $ _num_ .
it was a plain ham and cheese omelette .
this restaurant reminds me of cute little hole in the wall breakfast places .
unfortunately , it just can not compete with some of its neighboring restaurants .
the diner was n't particularly busy , but it was n't empty either .
while not at all healthy , i knew it was a pretty safe bet .
not anymore .
my husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and i had the veggie benedict .
rotten tomatoes ruin your taste for anything .
it 's pretty hard to make a bad chocolate chip pancake .
also the coffee was not good .
we were , to say the least very disappointed .
otherwise a complete waste of our money .
or previous experiences had is enjoying this establishment , but not this time .
we were disappointed , good chance we will not be returning .
poor selection , poor lighting , bad layout and overpriced .
late night madison is tough when you are hungry .
dining room is a little dingy for a chain .
hamburgers , fries , soda and of course a frosty .
likely the hamburger gave me food poisoning friday night .
my husband and son were ok , and they had nearly identical meals .
everything that is wrong with chain restaurants .
unlimited fries with every sandwich ?
really bland tasting food , and annoying atmosphere , as well as annoying staff .
the food has nothing unique about it .
quite uncomfortable , but the only seating available .
it was an experience that i will never forget .
i will be in no hurry to go back .
poor service , noisy , but pretty good food .
dude knew one thing , which was that he had not made a mistake .
upon further review , management is not getting the proper training .
it is not ok to treat a customer like that guy treated me .
could n't believe how long it took to be served below mediocre food .
we were seated promptly and our drink order was taken .
our appetizer finally arrived - but no soup .
the fries were cold on all our meals .
at that point i was disgusted - and done .
someone by the name of justin apologized , who was he ?
they could have put them back on our card 's .
extremely rude ended up leaving before we could even order .
but my low point is for the service .
we wait during _num_ minutes or more and never receive any waitress .
not our first visit , not our first choice .
extremely overpriced , underwhelming food .
$ _num_ for a meh burger ?
if i could have given today 's experience negative stars , i would have .
nothing beyond what you can get anywhere else in this city .
this is what took red robin straight into the toilet .
from the moment we walked in , this place felt different .
she did n't even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime .
just went all ghost and ignored us .
no big deal .
at no point does the manager come by to check on us .
not many customers at the time .
sat waiting _num_ minutes for a server to bring us menus .
there were _num_ or _num_ servers standing around chatting with each other .
was told a _num_ minute wait that turned into _num_ .
poor timing of food service .
bad experience , red robin !
anyway , the rating is for the food .
but after our most recent visit , i 'm not feeling the love .
we did n't receive any fries until they brought our order .
when she brought the bills , there was no discount .
i was very disappointed with the entire visit .
if your looking for quality customer service this is not the place to go .
food was not the greatest and the service was extremely slow .
there were no chunks of potato or clams .
the replacement was not the greatest in taste .
i really was hoping for good food not money off of our order .
wine or beer ?
no way .
service : terrible - overly helpful , yet completely unhelpful .
i 've made better wine .
in the end , they were shitty wines , and it a shitty experience .
which is too bad , because i was really looking for something nice .
horrible service , old flowers .
perhaps good product , but really poor service .
the only way its worth the money is going all day .
multiple people acted really rude .
she also stated everything was in stock .
the sales guy went down to get everything and i waited an hour .
finally he comes back and again it 's not going to work .
i could not believe it .
truly sad .
i had asked for the manager to call me and he did n't .
no respect .
he did not care .
the next day , i was sick all day .
you will be very sorry that you did !
do you like greasy overcooked american chinese ?
still terrible .
dragon & phoenix , eh pretty bad .
i went to lunch here once and then never again .
my advice , avoid this place at all costs .
your hard earned money is better spent at a different chinese take-out restaurant .
i used to eat here all the time but they 've lost my business .
the guy i talked to was completely rude they lost my business forever .
bad service average chinese food .
not worth anything .
gross .
went to noodles for lunch on a saturday , place was not busy .
bathroom was disgusting .
no paper towels .
plates and bowls ( all of them ) were chipped .
not sanitary .
for some reason it just was not hitting the spot with me .
frankly it was nowhere to be found .
very disappointing .
additionally , my japanese pan noodle bowl left much to be desired .
while i like noodles & company in general , this location is lacking .
that makes them a fast food outlet , no more .
unacceptable and disgusting .
order was taken right away and served promptly .
there were people at one other table and i believe _num_ people on staff .
also , the prices are too high .
these guys rip you off .
i went in to the urgent care as i was having severe ear pain .
i was very insulted .
i even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy .
i 'll keep trying , though .
boring .
it has a vanilla custard base with waffle cones and chocolate pieces in it .
first , there was not many piece of chocolate or waffle cone in it .
i like their vanilla ice cream , this flavor did nothing for it .
boring .
i should have just gotten vanilla and skipped the frustration .
the blueberries are really hard and frozen .
it was hard to enjoy because the blueberries were so hard .
i really like the donut , the pie , just everything .
it was too sweet and did not have a good cream flavor .
making cream flavored ice cream and adding chocolate does not make it boston cream .
the effort was there but the execution was sad .
i wish i had taken pictures of my visit today .
a _num_ year old electric stove ( $ _num_ ) .
an antique dresser with missing handles ( $ _num_ ) .
there goes $ _num_ .
of course the unit has an error code _num_ months later .
pretty disgusted with the service and the way i was treated .
although they may sell a good product , they are way overpriced .
shop around , they are really money hungry .
customer service was pitiful .
avoid this place .
friday fish fry was awful .
my boyfriends fish was also disappointing .
our party was seated _num_ minutes after ordering .
my bland plate of fish was n't something i 'll come back for .
i 'm just too use to food with seasoning on it .
after three attempts , we finally rode out the wait for the fish fry .
that seems to be the draw of this dumpy little joint .
the restaurant equivalent of flying coach .
it was not good .
walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time .
the bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible .
horrible service !
crappy food !
we put in our order for _num_ entrees and an appetizer .
it was about _num_ minutes before we were finally seated .
the hashbrowns with cheese were pretty bland and nothing to write home about .
was really excited to try their fish fry after hearing many raves .
i have too much to lose .
so i get the bartender and explain the story .
she does nothing but tell him to apologize .
so he sticks his hand out and says sorry .
come to find out the owner was the male bartender .
1st time and as i say one and done .
this place was an ass backwards train wreck .
the steak was full of gristle and had no flavor .
me no never will i stop again .
yeah , long story short ... .
the food sucked ass .
my lobster was obviously frozen burned and way way way over cooked .
the lady at the front desk tells me i 'll owe $ _num_ .
the little asian dentist comes in and once again ( surprise ! )
so i saved $ _num_ just by not going to door creek .
absolutely ridiculous .
absolutely ridiculous .
this is a harsh review but these things matter .
do not allow your dogs to go to daycare here .
not cool .
no accommodations were offered .
i would n't recommend this hotel to anyone !
this place is beyond terrible !
but stupid expensive drinks and the bartenders do not give very good service .
and only then if there is nothing else going on .
this place is awful .
no hot single chicks here .
slow service for both the drinks and our food .
waitress never checked to see if i wanted another drink .
places like this should be using mystery shoppers to test and improve their service .
it was not good .
it was not bad .
cole slaw was horrible in a little cup .
when we were half done eating she tried to clear our plates .
i really have no desire to return ever again .
the others are n't so great .
and it was indeed mediocre .
my chicken sandwich was pretty basic california chicken .
it came smothered in some sort of spread .
my sandwich felt apart immediately .
ugh .
i did n't get sick from eating it , so that 's a plus .
so the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived .
people seem to like their pizza , so maybe go with that .
no way .
the worst place to watch sports in madison !
waited over _num_ 1/2 hours to receive our apps .
gross .
looked like a party on a budget .
was n't much blue cheese in it .
my girlfriend immediately felt sick and only ate one piece .
weak tap beer line up .
marginal service levels .
the only plus , not many people showed up and good sound .
ignored it for the movie while they continued being loud and rude throughout .
they did n't even go in and check .
horrible excuse for theater staff and keeping the bs out .
when the occasion calls for it i upgrade to a purse .
but this time it created a problem .
but you see i was wrong about what they were looking for .
i was not the only one standing there .
another patron complimented me on the points i made to tom , the manager .
the box office person did not even realize that a time was cancelled .
everything else started during the _num_ o'clock hour .
it was offensive to be suggested that i see some other movie .
tonight , they lost at least ten patrons ( that i could see ) .
just check it ?
ca n't come in at all with it ?
expensive for food that is mediocre .
lame .
wrong .
it 's just bad .
horrible , horrible service .
the second time , they lost me as a customer .
the food was okay , nothing special .
if i could give them zero stars , i would .
horrible .
i went there once and had a horrible waitress .
i ordered a small deep dish pizza and it was dripping in grease .
i do n't suggest going to this place at all .
i do n't suggest coming here for a good time .
i eventually just gave up trying to call them .
the restaurant was not busy at all .
walked in and had to wait for the hostess .
the manager came to apologize , offered us a free dessert .
oh yea , then we had to wait for the check !
lost another customer .
needless to say , we took our business elsewhere .
i am disappointed to say the least .
too many other fine restaurants in madison to give this one another try .
under new ownership , the place is now called metro ford of madison .
beyond the cheesy exterior , he was nice .
here 's where i 'm not happy .
after leaving the business office my salesman takes me over to my new ride .
so i wait an hour for the truck to be cleaned properly .
i want to know how to operate the towing package .
i do n't want to take a call from god knows who !
lousy service once they have your money .
horrible place !
bad service !
i gave them _num_ full business days to fix my car .
i called my insurance company to let them know they are bad for business !
they do n't even deserve a _num_ star !
they cheated me almost _num_ thousand dollar which is very huge amount for me .
i was cheated around _num_ $ .
please be very careful if you still want to visit this showroom .
i would never do business with anyone at this firm again .
it was hit or miss and its been hot !
he was in a hurry to get out too .
it cost me 1/4 of what i paid all comfort for nothing !
i stopped in without a reservation and luckily they had a room .
not ultra modern , but contemporary design .
noisy and annoying ?
the fault of courtyard ?
not really .
however , what happened that night , i could n't sleep through .
so not entirely their fault , but still was a very bad experience .
i love dogs and feel bad for all of them that are in there .
that being said , i think that they would be better off elsewhere .
i have lived in other places and no one runs a shelter like this .
i was like this makes no sense she is a wheelchair .
dog rooms not so bad .
no bueno !
blech !
this place was a huge disappointment .
the place was overpriced and left me with a not so fresh feeling .
we ordered the food over the phone and it was ready in _num_ minutes .
negatives : it is not cheap .
there was not very much included with our dinner .
i was really disappointed and felt a little cheated .
but the woman who runs the restaurant with her husband blew my mind .
`` hmm ... cheap .
at this point i shrugged and took out some cash .
then she just stared at me .
i realized she wanted me to give her money for having my card declined .
but she could n't tell me , because she did n't know .
the fees are reasonable and customers generally like using it .
i 'm a big fan of sushi and was not impressed by anything here .
the seaweed salad was fine and the hot sake was average .
the rolls left for more to be desired .
i left feeling hungry and disappointed .
i was very disappointed .
what a lazy job they were doing in there .
but i wish the sandwiches were a little bigger .
i guess i 'll try the french bread next time .
miller 's is n't bad -- but it 's nothing special either .
want a room with scary stains and torn carpeting ?
the breakfast buffet was pretty weak .
the room was fine but nothing fancy .
the _num_ people at the front desk ignored us when we first came in .
i was left feeling confused .
he has never had a problem like this .
we will not be staying there again .
this easily ranks among the worst .
after getting into the room i was n't much happier .
this not a three and a half star place .
it sucks .
toilet is cracked .
staff are not nice .
crazy loud noise at _num_ am was ignored by staff .
unfortunately , the entire city of madison moves on the same day .
so , we had no other place to stay .
if you have a choice , i would not recommend this place .
-they only spent _num_ minutes on my car and it shows .
no appt possible for detailing on weekends !
could the rumors be true that they protect certain clientele from bad reviews ?
overall it was a terrible car wash .
they seem to loose sight of what it means to detail a car .
they wiped my interior with a wet cloth , end of story .
worse place to get your car washed .
they talked more than detailing .
while the rest of the world gets a skinny sandwich and crap service .
i suggest going down the road to university station and hit the subway there .
someone please teach the employees here how to better scrub the toilets .
i almost lost my appetite after using the women 's restroom .
i was wrong .
when i want to drink at a dive i want the lights dim .
the bartender was nice but the place was empty .
it is wrong , and i was wrong for eating it .
few times in my life have i been so wrong .
the workmanship was alright but the customer service was mediocre at best .
it took many visits to ensure the job was done correctly .
i would recommend you look elsewhere for better service .
this place is awful .
we both received terrible service .
and its only _num_ dollars .
do not come here , you will be greatly disappointed .
overpriced and poor quality .
totally disrespectful and horrible job !
stopped in for relaxing mani before my trip and walk out posting this !
that said , my concerns with them were on going from the get go .
it was bad .
crusty on the outside , yet dense and soft on the inside .
i would have happily given you five stars just for your plain bagel .
they had the consistency of cardboard and no flavor .
i would never order from this location again , they are very slow .
the pizza had no feta cheese at all .
... no more domino 's for me .
i spent $ _num_ for my nails to last _num_ days !
what kind of business does n't stand behind their work .
) .
when she did , she ordered me to wash my hands .
i would return only if i could guarantee an appointment with the adult employees .
i was treated horribly !
the lady used old acrylic and it made my nails yellow !
she was rude and i will never go here again !
on two separate occasions , i stumbled upon really expired food .
gross .
since i have been only to _num_ so far this is on average ground .
there is a discount _num_ dollar bin as well .
you can also select online coupons to load to your card from the website .
incredibly depressing store .
i do n't see how they failed to miss a burned out part .
they really are n't out to impress , only to fill your belly .
i kind of wish that the menu would be more clear .
this is the worst bbq resturant i 've ever are at .
i ca n't believe i 'm writing this .
tonight was an epic fail on customer service .
when it was our turn he handed phone to the person .
it was partially wrong so i corrected and she said ok and hung up .
when the food arrived it was totally wrong .
so disappointed .
i would describe this place as mediocre at best .
i wish there was a way to give zero stars .
my first ( and only time there ) was a horrible experience .
only thing left was the meat .
sad , sad , sad experience .
coleslaw : shredded cabbage with straight vinegar on it .
i 'm pretty sure there were no other ingredient .
mac & cheese : disgusting .
black dog is minutes away but did n't want to bother .
that was a huge mistake .
crappy fast food ?
but was n't a big fan of the sides .
price was not counted correctly .
come to find out he was a manager .
i was not impressed at all !
what pork i tasted that was n't smothered in beans was n't too bad .
not a place i will re visit .
they do n't watch the expiration dates on many products , so always check .
the aisles are too small .
never been out of there under _num_ minutes after 5pm .
so if you have a choice do not come to this post office .
zero stars .
no help at all .
not that hard to deliver mail .
i would give them _num_ stars if possible .
courteous service can only go so far .
i went to take some dry cleaning here and was disappointed .
the last time i ate there was the last time .
skip it and go to sam 's cafe .
so someone my girlfriend knew said that this was the place to try .
after the drive we were starving so we needed food .
had chicken and noodles my noodles where not done at all .
the place looked clean , service i had better too .
i guess twice was enough for me .
we had the beef steak , fried chicken , and ham and beans .
even the apple dumplings were just okay .
the bedding had burn holes from cigarettes and also had the awesome cigarette smell .
do n't stay here there are better places in urbana .
i would never stay here again .
the room itself was very basic , which i expected and did not mind .
very thin walls increased the noise .
we requested new sheets for _num_ rooms because of blood and other stains .
all were very dirty with stains from floor to ceiling .
absolutely ridiculous .
only stay here if you are _num_ .
the place is dirty dirty dirty .
the carpet in the hallway is very dirty .
so i have made them a lot of money staying there .
but the blankets are nasty full of burn marks .
kenny the manager is very inconsiderate and not reasonable .
the hallway floors were nasty & so was the room .
very very very dirty , maybe a local party motel for the university nearby .
the coffee is bad .
also , the coffee only comes in small cups .
jar of rocket fuel , but settled for _num_ oz .
i think steak 'n shake is just not my style .
every other part of the meal was a disaster .
my burger was missing everything but meat and cheese .
this place is sad .
never washing his hands and never wearing gloves .
this place is a total joke !
save your hard earned money and avoid this steak 'n shake at all cost .
server was good but the kitchen sucked .
_num_ min for a chicken melt and a chilli mac .
the waitress was rude .
kept looking down at us and service was slow .
this is a horrible steak and shake !
the floor is dirty and sticky and my food was cold .
i ordered the eggplant chicken special .
i was very excited after recently having some excellent garlic eggplant from green jade .
as it turns out , i celebrated a bit too soon .
the eggplant was n't thoroughly cooked , making it sort of bitter and tough .
also , they did n't use chinese eggplant , which was sort of confusing .
it was american ( globe ) eggplant .
that dish was not spicy in the least .
they were stale and not very good .
still , i do n't think i 'll be back .
i went there again today , ordered the szechuan chicken and was very dissapointed .
never gives total over the phone .
ick .
they hire kids that do n't care much about the customers .
while others walked out with their pizzas loaded .
a poor substitute for tex-mex food .
uninspired and bland food choices .
i 'd give it a zero if i could .
this place is weak as fuck .
the location of this restaurant needs to be updated .
the beef was utterly dry and flavorless .
i did not feel welcomed here at all .
our server seemed impatient and annoyed with us .
he asked us immediately after sitting down what we wanted to order .
he looked horrified but went away anyway .
my burritos were boring and tasteless .
nothing seems to stay there for long .
this is one place that really needs to go away !
it was awful !
gross man !
lately the sides have been awful .
the okra and casserole were cold .
it was the same casserole but now was steaming hot and tasteless .
that in my opinion is really poor customer service .
it 's hit or miss and i am getting tired of it .
no big deal there .
strike _num_ .
with two steaks sent back , i 'm not exactly getting the royal treatment .
my coke was empty .
i think this breaks a record for me .
never has it ever taken this many attempts to get it right .
the steak was kinda ... meh ... not great nor bad .
there was n't a good steak flavor as i 'd expect from a restaurant .
the baked potato was delivered piping hot .
all in all , i 'm quite a bit disappointed with this visit .
probably not soon .
i 'll stick with something i normally get like fried chicken or pot roast .
do not go to this restaurant if you are a person of color .
learn from my errors , find somewhere else for your small engine repair work .
i went on-line and bought the replacement parts for _num_ bucks .
anyway skip this place for service they clearly do n't want oil change business .
not really a `` farm '' person .
i had purchased tires here a year prior to my most recent visit .
never heard back even though i followed up twice .
do not bring your vehicle to farm & fleet .
ordered one thing online and they shipped a completely different product .
avoid at all cost !
still no chairs .
supposedly they are ordered .
still nothing from the store .
no call .
no replacement furniture .
not a kid friendly location .
then , i spent another few weeks waiting for a call back .
the service is awful and you will often receive things you did n't order .
the pizza was pretty bland , despite a hefty helping of oregano .
there is very little sauce , fairly dry cheese , and a chewy crust .
the small salad was n't their best .
the service sucked .
the waitress did n't give us refills and nothing was clean .
she gave us our check but never came back to take our money .
i will not be back because of the horrible service .
i could n't believe what i was hearing .
wo n't make this mistake again .
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .
the location is literally _num_ miles from the house .
should not take this long to replace an item .
going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread .
within a month they have messed up _num_ of our pizzas .
our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue .
avoid this place at all costs !
i would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery .
there was an additional location listed for champaign which turns out to be closer .
the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .
i 'm really not sure how this place has gotten such high ratings .
the complementary breakfast is not good .
i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .
no luck with calling for any help in complaint .
ownership does n't seem to care .
will go elsewhere next time .
their hours stink .
are you freakin ' kidding me ?
you wo n't be doing it this sunday .
so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .
this has been the worst haircut experience of my life .
spend a little bit more money and save yourself the trouble and disappointment .
this is the worst place and the worst stuff i have ever met .
never ever go this place again .
this might have been the worst hair cut i have ever had .
inches off of my hair .
i am very very very unhappy .
there were to my knowledge _num_ employees in the salon doing nothing .
i was wrong .
clearly they do n't want my business !
very disappointed and hurt that my business was not accepted here .
overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .
she told me no .
completely incompetent staff .
_num_ classes are where learning goes to die .
the weather here is horrible .
unfortunately they did not maintain high standards .
but some should be avoided completely .
after my first order from this place i would n't dare order again .
i ca n't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place .
never ordering from this place again .
but i was n't in the mood for meat .
bland , boring , and worst of all , super greasy .
now that 's what i call mediocre !
i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .
cons : decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross .
the biggest con , however ?
the egg roll was disappointing .
it used to be good .
but today the barista made me so mad !
it 's like a sunday evening and there 's seriously no one here .
it 's not like i took a long time deciding what i wanted .
really , the worst of the espresso locations on campus .
the coffee here is atrocious .
cup of flavorless grey water .
third strike , you 're out !
i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .
ick .
sick .
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .
i do n't know what to say .
it 's just milk , dude .
the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .
the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .
with the starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here .
the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .
terrible customer service .
rob you blind at every turn .
not at all from my experience .
_num_ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .
they refused , and charged me $ _num_ dollars !
one lady started working on her while i proceeded to wait another _num_ minutes .
there 's no organization and it is just ridiculous !
after using the tools they 've just returned tools to this dirty mug .
they do not clean their own furniture and floor .
disgusting .
this is very strange for me .
i went to get my nails and toes done and left so unhappy .
not a lot of nail salons open on sunday here .
the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .
the place was terrible .
however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .
she did but her parents did nothing and said nothing .
i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .
it 's a piece of junk .
the only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk .
the bulbs are n't hot , and the customer service was poor .
it was not worth fighting campus traffic to get there .
we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .
not helpful .
needless to say , this business ranks among the most poorly run in town .
i ordered a _num_ ' truck with no extras for my move .
this place is awful !
the employees are either dumb or just do n't give a shit .
they 're unorganized and totally clueless .
i have never used a business so poorly run .
or maybe they 're all this bad .
terrible .
also , the boxes that i bought there fell apart .
this location is weird .
their customer service is terrible .
this is unacceptable .
this place needs at least two more employees , and better customer service .
it 's fine but such a hassle for a $ _num_ rental .
it ends up costing me around _num_ minutes .
he made no effort to reach a resolution .
terribly slow .
terrible service .
other locations do much better than this one , it 's a shame really .
did n't even get to try it .
that 's not what i got .
my time was absolutely wasted .
cheap drinks .
one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .
hate this bar .
the only good time to go is when it 's nearly empty .
i do n't get why people go here just for the wings .
i 've had bad times at brothers .
it gets too crowded to play darts .
guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it .
it seems to be totally random .
never wasting my time at brother 's again .
my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .
_num_ ) never enough space .
disgusting .
_num_ ) hot as hell .
you 'll be sweating just standing there even in the middle of winter .
the fans on the ceiling are useless .
more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .
have no place to stand or sit .
also , the dj 's are inept .
the buzz - only reason this is getting _num_ stars .
i would avoid this company at all costs !
please avoid this company at all costs .
on top of that these people are condescending assholes .
do not use these people , they are terrible .
i was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before .
my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different .
it was very salty and unpleasant .
i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry .
_num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .
never again stay away from this place !
i 've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of .
there was n't a lot of options , only about _num_ items .
both of which were disappointing !
the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .
around $ _num_ to share _num_ dishes .
but now it 's barely passable .
their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty .
it was a very disappointing .
in my opinion , that is way too long for an hour lunch break .
we walked in and it was very hectic .
_num_ minutes had gone by and nothing .
_num_ minutes .
about _num_ minutes later , our first dish came out .
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .
however , my last two visits were terrible .
they simply served it .
the first time i was not sure .
i ca n't imagine why this would happen .
i ordered the hot pot and it was n't even a hot pot .
there was no soup ( wtf ) !
the food is oily and lacks flavor .
overall , i feel like i really wasted my money here .
i would give zero star if i could .
this place is a total rip off .
the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _num_ .
had i not asked she would never had told me .
i said belly , and a magical one dollar was added to my bill .
then i specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not .
at this point , i was beyond pissed by this dishonest act .
hell i will never ever return to this restaurant .
this is a horrible place .
even after they have already known you are healthy .
she is so bad that i get anxiety talking to her .
she makes mistakes , she shows her ego , and she does not care .
they do n't know how to bill correctly !
another issue i had is for another annual exam .
better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to !
for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .
get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .
avoid going here at any cost !
very rude and unhelpful staff when it comes to complaints !
just save yourself lots of follow-up problems with billing and go to another place !
i did n't even have the chance to describe all of my symptoms !
the vomit smell is even there at like 8am on tuesday mornings !
it deserves zero stars .
worst .
who are you people giving these stupid reviews ?
this place is a nightmare .
there is nothing redeeming about this place .
the only time i 'm ever here is during a bar crawl .
the drinks were worse and painfully weak .
i was horrified to see people in formal wear .
the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .
do n't they clean the floors ?
that was the only reason it did n't get one star .
just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .
i 've been in the place once and it is gross .
i ca n't imagine going to this place at a peak time .
this bar stinks !
came here _num_ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .
it still smelled like vomit , stale beer , and service sucked .
worst bar i 've been to , period .
went there to party , fun , but the establishment itself sucks .
regretted that in _num_ hours .
what an absolute dump .
one star is too much .
what a mistake .
bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .
i wish i could give _num_ stars .
after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .
the woman at the counter was friendly , but the food was disappointing .
there were flies all over the place .
the produce looked so sad and wilted .
it was `` _num_ five alarm hot sauce '' level .
i could barely eat it .
ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .
unfortunately this was not the case .
the chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland .
why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada .
these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .
the problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked .
the refried beans was a soupy mess , but the mexican rice was passable .
pro : none ... .
i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .
slowest service i 've ever had .
waitress also did not know anything about menu items .
avoid !
i was pretty stupid when i was _num_ .
needless to say it was also too crowded , dark and dirty .
they said they were delivered so they could not give me my money back .
i wasted a trip .
very disappointing considering their job is flowers and the flowers they have are terrible .
ridiculous mean !
so maybe i am not the target audience .
the problem is that the meat is not very good .
it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .
disappointed .
the only thing i paid for was the convenience of eating on green st .
green street did n't feel the same without you since you burned down .
although the ambiance is much improved , my gyro lacked taste .
soft , tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce .
the greek salad was n't anything special either .
the salad does n't have enough cheese !
there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .
this is where it falls short .
the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .
additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .
overall a little disappointing .
not a big fan .
also no .
i felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star .
this place is horrible .
the service is very rude .
it was a really weird experience .
well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .
we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .
the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .
i am a big gnocchi snob , and these were so gross .
i hated it .
sorry luna , after two attempts now , i 'm not coming back .
but , ok , they were short on menus .
the menu shortage ( ?
oily salmon leftovers .
one of our _num_ orders came out wrong .
the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .
however , their new location is n't as great as the old one .
we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .
luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus .
i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .
and the cooks could n't even cook it through the second time ?
they did n't apologize or act like they cared at all .
the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?
we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .
the potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it .
so i guess that was a bad selection .
they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .
however , the service is so-so .
way too expensive for crap like that .
the food was ok , a bit overpriced but not awful .
like several other reviews here have said , they are just not the same .
she brought the table of _num_ four slices of bread .
the dishes were extremely underwhelming , and the first _num_ or _num_ were cold .
there is no way these could count as tapas .
needless to say , very disappointing , not worth the hefty price tag .
but this is not a great restaurant ; it 's a lazy restaurant .
no way .
food was overpriced and low quality .
_num_ hours for lunch is too long .
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .
i have visited luna four times now and each time is worse than before .
the service is soooo slow .
no thank you .
there was so much salt on it , i could n't eat it .
this place is so overrated it 's not even funny .
first and second , i went with a group for brunch .
my second trip , our group had reservations and we still waited _num_ minutes !
third ( and i 'm afraid final ) visit was a disaster .
our food orders were not taken at the same time ; not even close .
of course that was all wrong and took another half hour .
it 's so cold , loud and crowded .
disgusting !
_num_ courses .
without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .
the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .
terrible .
cheap quality .
i would n't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco .
i swear on my life this is the worst steak i 've ever had .
and it was like _num_ % tough , inedible fat .
i could make a better steak when i was _num_ .
the lamb chops were so tough , we could n't even eat them .
and it was still awful .
it was impossible to chew .
this was just unacceptable .
i could n't find it from the actual review page !
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .
however , this nightmare did not end then .
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting !
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?
they took down my review twice ... .
it was not offensive at all except stating the facts .
the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .
disgusting .
threw out a $ _num_ plate of food after finding hair .
wait , no , not identical .
the main courses cost about $ _num_ more than on green street .
the food was okay and plentiful , but the wait service was horrible .
however , after the last outing i will not go back .
it was a very unwelcoming place .
; and a totally inept management of the tables .
sub-par indian food , which passes in town .
how is that there is no good indian food in champaign-urbana ?
the food here is generic and bland .
not worth the money .
i walked out with a severe case of food poisoning .
gross .
$ _num_ for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain .
no rice .
around 9pm , i called again .
i tried calling , and no one picks up .
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .
the lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch .
i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .
will not come here ever again .
the food is just average indian food , nothing special .
rice was stale , cold , and hard .
incredibly poor food quality .
does n't seem like they put any effort into their food or service .
i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .
very disappointed by this experience .
i had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing .
i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .
veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .
they were so oily and soggy .
i was hoping samosa will save the day but hell no : ( .
the filling was bland , the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky .
the only thing tasting good was tea , which was made by me .
that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .
no one should pay $ _num_ for _num_ pages of paper .
i did n't like this place .
first , the service is slow .
gyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy !
so , this place is so overrated !
thumbs down !
unfortunately !
what i did n't expect was for my order to take _num_ .
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?
under those conditions , i say go for it .
the only thing that kept us coming back was their awesome chicken strips .
you 're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you so .
i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .
i was just killing time and saw this shop .
i have n't been treated that bad in a store since i was _num_ .
your little model cars on the wall were filthy .
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .
then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye .
not very fast .
been _num_ minutes .
disappointed .
rude .
the dogs there are all sad .
can we say gross ?
it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .
literally , i went orange eating it .
just bad .
hardly sanitary ) .
every time ( no joke ) they have messed up my order .
i would not recommend this restaurant .
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .
this is the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life .
a total waste of money .
ate here a while ago and did n't really like the food .
read the bad reviews .
knew it was not going to be that great .
got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible .
fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .
avoid at all cost .
why go here when there are much better restaurants around .
i really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible .
but why the hell would i do that ?
in addition , it 's only steamed rice and not fried rice .
however , the food is practically tasteless .
this , i have to say is a major disappointed .
avoid at all cost .
i was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight .
the spring rolls were okay , i suppose , though really not that great .
the problem was really with the basil chicken : it was honestly quite gross .
first , why do they use ground chicken ?
that 's just wrong .
ground chicken is wrong .
and the dish was just not good .
i ate a little bit of it and was done .
for the next half hour i had a gross taste in my mouth .
lesson learned : even thai food is n't always a safe choice .
the latter ( basil thai ) is by far the worst .
ugh .
a curry dish with barely any veggies ?
no , potatoes do not count .
curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor .
however , given a choice , why go and have bad food ?
however , there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town .
nothing but bad service here .
the car was not ready when i arrived .
he would n't help me out in anyway and was just a terrible employee .
bad customer service .
i do not recommend it !
by far the worst service i have ever had in my life .
i did n't even know that was possible .
oh god , where do i start ?
be warned , this company will absolutely nickel and dime you .
staff is rude , inconsiderate .
staff is not friendly .
i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .
but that 's not the worst part .
why not appeal to god directly ?
i will not be returning to this location for anything .
why would i get a service that is n't recommended ?
their approach to customer service is bizarre .
they stopped the upsell after that .
then , i started having performance problems with my tires .
i know they can wear early , but that is really early .
that explains my poor performance !
but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .
worse place in town !
when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry .
very very rude staff !
the food however , was underwhelming .
spicy tuna was terrible .
the taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale .
do n't waste your time .
the price may be decent , but the food lacks the same feeling .
first of all this is not one of my favorite types of foods .
the portions are really small which really did n't bother me .
it was about a _num_ inch by _num_ inch square .
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .
( and i am not exaggerating , that was what she told us . )
the food was horrible .
and the service was the worst thing at this place .
ugh .
this is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation .
menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .
worst japanese food in town !
we were refused service and told they were getting ready to close .
i can not image turning away business in a poor economy .
it was strange and somewhat offensive .
the problem with this place is the service .
no kidding ?
not , apparently .
we actually had to leave , i had an appointment .
overpriced , mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation .
this place does neither .
but they put onions on every aspect of my bento box .
my below average bento box cost a total of $ _num_ too .
the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .
on a saturday evening , we waited _num_ minutes without anyone taking our orders .
waited another _num_ minutes , still no one to take our order .
so we walked out .
not enough waiters , the chef has to come out to serve by himself .
bad management , ca n't hold a dinner service on a saturday night .
everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .
my friend and i went there and order ramen .
the service is very slow .
the ramen is so bad .
this place is a joke !
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful !
same awful service .
we could all smell trash while sitting there .
so sad !
horrible service !
tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .
so i go back to get it adjusted .
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal !
maybe because they did n't want to do business with me .
i spent m it was such bad luck that i went to the location .
i wish i never had known about the place .
it did n't have a lot of flavor .
i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .
but the fried chicken was not that good .
it was really dry .
the fish is n't anything special either .
when i walked in it was not a welcoming atmosphere .
they acted like i was bothering them and i felt rushed to order .
maybe it 's because i am not a regular .
it was neither .
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .
i love the okra and the collard greens .
however their customer service is the worst .
the food was just sitting on the counter .
i will not come back to this place ever again .
went here , was n't aware of what time they close .
so we went in and wasted _num_ min .
if i could give _num_ stars i would , or maybe even negative stars .
the wait is insane .
just rude .
would not recommend this restaurant !
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .
fridays and your applebee 's .
well , it 's not like that anymore .
it was disgusting .
i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .
but now it 's not .
the house salad is awful and so are all the soups .
she apologized and said no one had told her that we were there .
i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .
but the bruschetta was just awful .
she never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted .
no apology , nothing .
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles !
over _num_ hours for an average meal .
it 's always slow when we go , but that was just insane .
the service was the worst i have had in some time .
one bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm .
very poor quality food .
the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .
our pizza was mushy and undercooked .
i could n't eat it .
the description was nothing like the actual entree .
extremely poor service !
alas not so good .
somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing .
unfortunately , not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy .
typical olive garden , standard menu , nothing special .
party of _num_ .
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .
we did n't have enough time for our app .
i have zero complaints about our food , just the service was awful .
good food but lacks a family friendly environment .
i did not like the sausage .
let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly !
i am usually extremely satisfied with champaign restaurants but this visit was pitiful .
i asked for my salad with no olives , it had olives .
i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .
i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .
she came to our table maybe _num_ times total .
i am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy .
the garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing .
salad dressing very sour .
: ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .
the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon .
but if you love quality and freshness , avoid !
the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .
overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .
the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .
was sadly disappointed .
sadly no other steak cut options .
i really do n't get some of the reviews of this place .
ok , you people need to get out of central illinois more ... .
just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye .
but you ca n't get any other cut of meat .
the salad bar is terrible .
unless you want a _num_ ounce ribeye .
let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .
when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .
the ribeye steak is low quality meat .
eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .
coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .
overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .
it just is not very good .
bread is a hot , fresh loaf , but mediocre nonetheless .
that is , prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values .
service is adequate but unremarkable either way .
for me , this all is about _num_ 1/2 stars on yelp .
disappointed .
worst .
why oh why ca n't we rate zero stars ?
knowing how bad the steak is , i ordered the shrimp .
_num_ times worse than the steak .
hell , even the courier cafe in urbana has a better salad bar !
disgusting .
not much flavor , and not a high quality meat .
and if that does n't work ask `` what restaurant is your favorite ? ''
first time out of maybe a hundred i did n't get a good recommendation .
the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .
_num_ bucks before the tip .
this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .
the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .
i do n't mean to trash this place too much though .
the ribeye said it was no problem .
you can get a mediocre steak for a lot less .
the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .
the shrimp is ok , too .
i am only halfway joking .
even with the full house we did not have a long wait .
i ordered a _num_ oz .
ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .
so ordered the _num_ oz .
they were not bad , but they were not sauted .
steak was below average and service was lacking .
i try to avoid them as much as possible .
they could n't even offer anything else !
... ... ... .
once again , a terrible experience .
unfortunately we had a gift certificate .
i will happily spend that money elsewhere .
never even came out of his hole in the back .
i do not recommend renting from u group at all .
they were extremely rude when my roommate and i called them .
maintenance is terrible !
the leasing manager is terribly rude and the staff is clueless !
avoid !
avoid !
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .
it smelled like the last tenant was someone with _num_ cats .
and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .
i spent saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power .
horrible apartments and management .
first they gave trashy apartment without cleaning .
second they do not agree that it is dirty .
never rent their apartment !
they do not care tenants at all .
it 's suffering living in their apartment year round .
the worst .
just a bad experience all around .
we tried really hard to keep it away .
can you imagine how terrified i was at that moment ?
there are _num_ men in my living room and i was in bed .
this is rude !
i can not think of a reason for the wall to be painted again .
lastly , my friend come to visit me in summer .
and the parking lot is almost empty during the summer .
so my friend parked at an empty lot .
then the car get towed .
why do n't you leave a note for a visitor 's car ?
you 're new , confused , slightly nervous about everything .
in the middle of the shelf , plain for all to see ?
not ok.
not ok at all .
and i thought , `` what the hell am i gon na do now ?
and i officially hate carrie 's now .
also , carrie is not always the most friendly shop owner .
did ya look down the hallway , asshole ?
so that 's not why it gets _num_ stars .
maybe it was the overall lack of options .
the people were n't friendly or helpful .
but there are problems with other members there .
how insulting .
i shop the bulk bins because there is variety .
should n't be a surprise , really .
no thank you .
i think most things here our overpriced and sub-par quality .
do n't go here if you can avoid it .
the next day my radiator tank was completely empty .
unreal negative experience .
items are overcharged and there is no return policy .
very dirty store with dust all over the shelves and items .
indifferent and unhelpful personnel does not know the inventory of the store .
this company is a complete fraud .
do n't give these people money .
i would give it zero stars if thats an option !
we were stranded at the bus stop for _num_ hours in the cold wind !
no apology .
no explanation .
no specific schedule for the next bus !
for dry cleaning they are extremely expensive .
they have lost our business for good .
well , no more .
on top of it all -- they are extremely expensive .
i used the fluff and fold service _num_ times .
the first time , i was missing some pants .
so that forced me to go there again .
do n't support this business please .
my husband brought in a suit and a $ _num_ coupon .
the fee for the suit was $ _num_ .
his charge should be $ _num_ , right ?
well , they charged him once for $ _num_ and again for $ _num_ !
however , now that it has happened twice , i do not trust them .
i drove down there with receipts .
it 's a shame it was the one closest to my apartment .
when i went to pick up my dry cleaning , the cover was gone .
needless to say , i wo n't be returning .
we used the laundromat and it is wicked nasty .
if i could give these movers a zero , i would .
so we used these folks -- it was a disaster from the beginning .
i 'll echo what another reviewer said : _num_ star is _num_ too many .
after two hours the movers never showed .
thirty minutes later no one shows and i call and cancel .
save yourself the worry and avoid like the plague .
she promised a quote the next day , which i never received .
your stuff will be _num_ weeks late , with broken and missing items .
if i could rate this company zero stars , i would .
very unhappy and unsatisfied customer .
the food was just okay , nothing to rave about .
as far as specialties go , i 'd say , the diner stack ?
i gave them another shot a few weeks later , this time for lunch .
not a fan .
however , no .
diner with overly hovering waitresses and bad orange juice .
but ick .
crispy yet soft , i could 've had platters of this thing .
maybe that 's snooty , but i just hate it .
they looked me in the eye but never acknowledged my presence .
unfortunately , champaign has a lack of diners and _num_ hour restaurants .
( and the quality delivered is mostly poor . )
too bad .
service _num_ stars , food _num_ stars , atmosphere _num_ stars .
so terrible .
i would have to say that the wait staff is top notch .
the sausage and eggs were good without complaint .
overall with the oil and salt , it was somewhat difficult to eat .
ordered a mega omelet with no ham , it comes back with ham .
the customer service was just that bad .
when i pointed it out to the waitress , she just shrugged .
so disappointed in the whole experience .
however , we were not asked if we wanted more .
wrong , not if they do n't ask you if you want more .
he also took my salad before i was done with .
he did n't bother to ask me if i was done with it .
they were so slow .
they were really salty and just ... well , not good .
we also split a burger , which was decent , but very very heavy .
i think i maybe had _num_ bites of it .
i refuse to go to tgi friday 's in champaign anymore .
however , truly bad service is inexcusable .
this is n't what bothers me .
at another restaurant i 'd be totally willing to forgive and forget .
i liked the fried green bean appetizer with wasabi ranch sauce quite a bit .
i wo n't be back .
disappointed .
normally things here are ok - nothing fantastic .
i got exactly _num_ tiny chunks of avocado and zero cilantro .
in addition , it was a hot mess .
the arrival of our food was the second disappointment of the night .
talk about bad presentation !
needless to say , he finished it but still went home hungry .
this is all on top of the ridiculous prices they charge .
almost $ _num_ for _num_ mozzarella sticks ?
$ _num_ for a small steak ?
bad values all around .
horrible , horrible , horrible .
the service was bad and the food was worse .
i love chain food but this place is awful .
i doubt i will ever go back to a tgi fridays at any location .
i ordered some sort of pasta alfredo with chicken .
the pasta was so overcooked it was mushy .
the chicken was so overcooked i could barely cut into it .
save yourself the time and money and avoid this place .
it was pretty trashy for the otherwise very nice atmosphere .
no thanks .
this place is an absolute joke .
it 's extremely overpriced ( $ _num_ for a solo ham and cheese crepe ?
and i asked for cheddar on top - what the hell ?
$ _num_ for shitty american shredded cheese ?
no thanks .
this is not the case here .
she then disappeared for the entire meal and came back only for the check .
thanks but no thanks .
i ordered a $ _num_ ham and cheese crepe .
once they took his empty soup bowl away , the wait began .
we probably did not get our food for another 20-30 minutes .
and again , there were _num_ other parties of _num_ in the restaurant .
no one even looked at us .
i do n't know why they could n't have used white flour .
the food is good but the customer service is awful .
not worth the hassle .
i took my children here while visiting my sister in champaign .
wrong .
it was nothing like it .
we could barely fill up _num_ minutes here .
the water interactive display had no water in it .
the sand exhibit was missing some sand .
i was wrong .
there were about _num_ people crammed into the main room , paying .
charlie and the chocolate factory was playing , but there was no volume .
i am not kidding .
these people are clueless .
we complained and were reluctantly given our money back .
what a sad , sad place .
to begin with , the place was dirty .
it looked like no one cared about it .
do n't be fooled .
avoid this place !
one word nasty !
i would n't recommend it .
dirty - everything is dirty and dusty .
plus - $ _num_ to get in ?
this was awful .
when the food showed up it was just as bland as the chips .
just unacceptable .
the food though , has much to be desired .
last night we went there and i got chicken tacos .
they were so horrible that i only took one bite .
they were that bad .
the chicken tasted like it was canned .
as the saying goes : i 've got _num_ problems .
getting the order wrong and forgetting a side ?
bad news .
worse news .
unfortunately i should have followed the negative reviews .
the rice was drenched in grease .
it even smelled bad as the waiter put it in front of me .
omg out out a bag , just horrible .
too mad for them because , as i said , i love mexican food !
everything was drowned in a red sauce that tasted canned .
however , our server was a really nice guy .
not very authentic , and my rice was severely undercooked .
they used yellow cheese on my tacos .
much better choices for mexican food in champaign .
unless you buy your tickets several weeks in advance .
did i mention i 'm having a slow day at work ?
it should n't be a big deal to go to chicago .
it should n't use up all my money or my patience .
chicago is a major travel hub and the closest major city .
the fact that it is so difficult to get to hurts the university .
the delays have ranged from _num_ hour to _num_ hours .
totally bland .
the american fries were a soggy mess and also without flavor .
did these reviewers eat the same stuff as i did ?
it was soggy and relatively flavorless .
do n't know what i ordered here but it was dirt cheap .
probably less than $ _num_ .
you get what you pay for but the food is cheap quick and easy .
there 's an _num_ % chance that sam could be serving you .
i 'm definitely never going back .
no clue how this has _num_ stars .
french toast was hidden like a pancake .
we were completely disappointed and frustrated afterwards .
so we sat down and the service was just terrible .
he talked way too fast and barely gave us time to respond .
did n't like him at all .
* another problem we had here .
there seems to be only one cook .
they talk about that customer as if she was in the wrong .
another problem are the extremely small tables .
cheap .
but that is where it begins and ends .
but other than those two things , i see no positives about this place .
stood in there for twenty minutes before anyone noticed us .
four tables without people , all covered with plates and trash .
we were told it would be awhile because there were no tables .
incredibly rude , clearly do n't care for customers or loyalty .
will not be returning .
the food was just s bit too greasy and eggs were over cooked .
they serve the typical junk food and it is very crowded during the weekends .
they have a few specials too , so do check those out .
i was in champaign last week , on a wednesday evening .
murphy 's was the only place with their kitchen open after 10pm .
i ordered a mega bacon cheeseburger and fries .
service here was terrible .
all in all , a terrible meal .
either way , that was a bit annoying , so strike two .
really murphy 's ?
what i was served was a ridiculously gross , flavorless hockey puck .
so , thanks , but no thanks murphy 's .
folks , i highly advise you to pass this place up .
do you get the idea it was bad ?
skip it and save yourself a possible trip to the dentist .
_num_ stars for tradition , _num_ stars for food quality and _num_ for service .
the female bartender that took our lunch order had zero personality .
i 'm glad it was n't a problem .
i 'd recommend drinking here at night , but not eating .
what a shit hole !
it was almost _num_ in the afternoon and i sat at a pub table .
it smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels .
i do not understand how this bar continues to exist .
but _num_ just leaves me speechless .
my point is , they have _num_ drink craftsmanship .
food : food service is poor though the food is fairly good .
if i were working all night i 'd get hungry too .
eh , this place was alright .
next off , i had the burger .
the fries were mediocre at best .
the onions were overwhelming and there were too many potatoes and not enough mushrooms .
i also asked for my eggs to not be runny and they were .
in a skillet that can be gross .
i only gave them two stars because that is what i truly feel .
as i said , food was mediocre .
wo n't try it again .
it just seems every time i go , something is n't right .
so on saturday i ordered the la petit french toast .
these reminded me of pancakes at ihop : bland tasting black holes for syrup .
originally i would have given this place _num_ or _num_ stars .
the server seemed annoyed and did n't assist me with any other options .
i ended up with _num_ eggs and a bowl of plain oatmeal .
slow service would n't even refill my drink .
interior is dingy and the tables were sticky i would not recommend this place .
it was n't horrible but it was definitely forgettable .
greasy old restaurant carpeting dirty .
$ _num_ for spaghetti ?
then the restaurant filled up and the service was non-existent .
but frankly , next time , i 'll go to the olive garden .
all in all i do n't know what we will ever go back .
i am in hopes the owners eventually make me want to return .
that just is n't possible ! ''
um , why would that be , exactly ?
they were t exactly busy but , ok , whatever .
so then the bill comes .
then , i looked at the bill .
sadly , none of that is true now .
it 's closed !
it was disgusting .
needless to say , we warned the next people who attempted to sit there .
still no sign of my food .
by now it 's been ten minutes .
i flag down the next passing employee , who happens to be the manager .
i tell him to cancel my order and give me a refund .
the drive through wait was longer than i had expected but not the worst .
she said she was just checking to be sure they were there .
i prefer a crisp cold salad like most people .
however , the ring of onion on it is very hot .
overall the booth 's were simply sticky .
worst customer service ever !
the worst i never had a problem with this in the past .
if they had run out would n't just put a sign up ?
nope just to lazy to change it .
as well no napkins in dining room at all !
and i always get sad because it is so gross in there .
i got there late and there was no seating .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
this place is totally overpriced , and they 're sloppy .
also , the massage chairs suck .
okay , so i went back to give this place a second chance .
total mistake .
needless to say , i definitely wo n't be coming here again .
they are rude and do a horrible job .
i 'm do n't giving this place a chance .
gross !
he cut my cuticles so low they started bleeding .
if i could give this less stars i would .
this place is completely shady and horrible .
would never recommend to anyone else .
zero stars !
worst pedicure of my life .
terrible service .
terrible pedicures .
somehow i find that their food is kinda bland .
so first things first , they do n't accept cash .
so i order one of the specials , which is tofu soup and fish .
so yeah , the food is okay , not too bad .
the owner was irritated as promised in other yelp reviews .
the boss trying to sell me something they want to sell , which sucks .
and the food is very low quality in all the korean restaurant .
never has a restaurant left more of an impression on me .
i have never felt worse after a meal or left more dissatisfied .
you could not pay me $ _num_ to eat the food i ordered again .
neither of us had eaten all day .
that 's _num_ cents an ounce .
the entire plate of nachos probably cost them $ _num_ .
apparently `` smothered '' burritos actually means fucking coated with nacho cheese .
you can tell i really hate this shit .
the beef in my tacos was ground fine .
not joking .
the beans were the texture of a watery soup .
the chicken taco was edible .
i was starving though .
i did n't touch the nacho cheese coated burritos .
you could tell the servers did not like working there .
our server did n't bring us the check .
also , the service was mediocre .
she was n't even bad , she just lacked a personality .
yuck , this place has really gone down hill .
the chips had no salt and the salsa tasted like ketchup .
it looked like baby food and did not hold together at all .
our server was attentive , i ca n't fault him .
we saw that on fridays they have a $ _num_ frozen strawberry margarita special .
they were n't even worth eating .
business is closed as of the end of november _num_ .
the bar portion also pretty bad .
it 's always hard to get the attention of the bartenders .
beer is n't great and it 's relatively expensive for what it is .
they also have a terrible patio in the back .
on top of that the food is n't really very good .
so it fails at being a bar and sports bar .
big mistake !
they came back from the bar after another 20+ minutes without drinks .
not to mention the utter lack of life on a friday night .
i want to punch that guy so bad .
i am so glad me and my friends do n't go here often .
the fries were cold and the service was less than desirable .
i do n't recommend anyone go to the champaign hooters .
food really , really bad .
i gave it _num_ [ $ ] just because it so overpriced .
this however was the worst food i have ever had at any location .
the chicken was so dry and cheese sauce was hard and tasted disgusting .
i just wanted a beer and the service was horrible .
maybe because it was monday night and the c team was working .
worst hooters ever !
walked out after sitting for _num_ minutes - no service .
waitress standing around .
empty tables all around .
not worth it .
we will not return to this place and never recommend to our friends .
maybe i 'll give it another try .
i 've never had such a horrible and disgusting excuse for fried rice .
there was nothing in it .
effing gross .
the chicken did not taste like general tso .
it was not spicy .
it was not flavorful .
dry , tough , stringy , chewy .
peking garden was a weird case for me though .
at the time , i would have almost gave it a _num_ star rating .
i was glad i did n't though .
the service was also bad this trip .
it was not fun especially since we both had to work later that day .
she informed me that it was carrots , onions , chicken and sauce .
it did n't even contain carrots or onions .
she replied , `` i do n't care ! ''
i wish i could rate _num_ stars .
rude !
the man yelled back and then hit him again .
no one should go to this restaurant .
something about the ambiance of the place puts me off though .
needless to say i was none too happy and gave up .
the sausage is still good , but everything else tasted like crap .
my daughter had the pancakes with link sausage .
the vegetable soup was ok but it had a lot of corn in it .
ordered a full order of biscuits & gravy , the meal came fairly quickly .
it was hot as well .
everything else ranges from okay to awful .
this place is the worst .
however , that does n't make up for the rude service .
terrible staff .
they are rude to their customers and act way more important than they are .
i explained to them that due to a condition i could not sit differently .
_num_ cats are ok in most places , no dogs .
washers and dryers in the complex sometimes work , usually do not .
also , outside and inside lights are quite frequently not working .
every single item on the list was checked to be cleaned .
that is outrageous and appalling .
this lasted at least _num_ months .
do not go there !
i am very disappointed in the pedicure i received today .
the whole experience was rushed , which made me feel very uncomfortable .
this lady ( the owner ) had an overall rough touch .
worst bar i 've ever been too .
pay $ _num_ dollars for cover and expect a complete waste of your money .
not even a hello or good morning !
this mall has really gone downhill in the past few years .
it seems as though no stores can survive there .
the food court is really nothing special .
i left the place and will not recommend it .
they do n't know their head from their ass .
the guy said they did n't sell anything like that .
_num_ people behind counter but i couldnt get waited on .
rude rude rude .
will never walk in store again .
the warranty will be valid , just need to contact customer service .
this required me to take a day off from work to receive the bed .
i feel like i am not a very valued customer .
i was not satisfied with my stay .
it had a cheap feel to it .
there was a time _num_ years ago when la quinta was a quality brand .
not anymore .
what really irritated me was the pricing .
a king bed is $ _num_ more than two beds .
better than most chain pizza , it 's ok .
its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top .
i did not like the pizza .
the waitress seemed to be a little rude .
slow service and bad food .
the pizza is just ok .
the appetizers are frozen and low quality .
service is always slow and they constantly forget basic things like straws .
cheap and perfectly adequate .
the kind of place you order from because it 's close and cheap .
they have some , but very limited in type and variety .
anyway , plenty of other bars that would be happy to have my money .
no , i do not need your assistance .
no , i do not want to discuss my weekend plans with you .
no , i do n't care anything about you or your life .
but the more i went , the less they seemed to want me there .
i 've learned cutting curly hair dry is almost always a disaster .
avoid at all costs !
also , the salon was a sauna !
overall , it was a really horrible experience .
awful , amateur job .
_num_ of the last _num_ times i 've been the order has been wrong .
i did n't realize either time until i got to work .
i 'm guessing they ca n't leave after work stars and neither can i .
went there numerous times and my orders have been messed up .
i hate this mcdonalds .
i 'm not exaggerating .
i 'm dead serious .
the worst quality mcdonald i have been to .
the other side is missing .
terrible service and management .
this is a terrible place for anybody looking to enjoy themselves .
if having fun is not your thing , check out fat city .
the second time i went was a tuesday night .
the worst i 've experienced in champaign-urbana .
drinks took literally _num_ minutes .
the food sucks .
never heard or experienced any thing like that before .
worse cleaning i have ever had .
i showed up _num_ minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested .
not `` chinese food '' .
just same things fried in same sauce .
i did not get them at panda express at the mall .
it was filthy and smelled so rotten i wanted to vomit .
they have seafood .
should n't that shit be in a cooler or something ?
what probably should have cost her $ _num_ cost her $ _num_ .
they only accept cash , probably because they make up prices as they go .
really do n't recommend to shop in this store .
lots of foods are expired and still on the shelf for sale .
that 's not the reason why i 'm giving far east _num_ stars .
i 'm not sure what is going on with that .
i would avoid the meat .
and i would avoid the produce .
too old .
too old .
check those expiration dates though .
you will often buy expired food and food without expiration date .
can not imagine the poor quality of some food .
they just put expired food at the most obvious place on the shelf .
not a happy girl here .
would not do again .
no biggie .
unbelievable .
her excuse was that my frames were to `` beat up '' .
i scheduled an appointment , then received a call the day before the appointment .
`` we ca n't take new contact appointments after 4pm . ''
`` we ca n't accept new contact appointments after 2pm . ''
this time i did not reschedule .
when i asked to speak with manager , she was not taking calls .
i ca n't stand this place ... .
forget it , that 's in another part of the store .
damn you toys r us !
we wasted all the time we had on that and got nothing else done .
dude , this pizza is gross .
i ca n't imagine why anyone would order from here .
too bad they would n't let me though .
something 's very wrong .
pizza is not anything to write home about , that is for sure .
why wo n't yelp let me give zero stars ?
the animal emergency clinic of champaign is a scam .
very minor stuff .
the original surgery itself was n't much more than that !
, but gave us back a dog that was covered in blood .
i brought my dog in who was very sick and not doing well .
humans do n't even get charged this much for simple iv therapy !
i do n't get it .
it 's not worth the visit .
now , super _num_ is ... a super _num_ .
i 'm so sorry , pops .
there is even a nicer super _num_ near lincoln avenue .
honestly , do n't stay here unless every other hotel is booked .
we waited too long to book and this was all we could find .
the sheets in the bed looked clean but they were very worn .
i just did n't want to touch anything in there .
we booked the room through priceline , only paid $ _num_ for room .
i do n't need fancy , i just need comfy .
it was so gross !
old , smelly , & creepy .
( of course my hubby would point out they had old tvs too . )
my hubby called to say he could n't stay there .
he went next door to la quinta for $ _num_ .
because i booked through priceline i was not allowed a refund .
this should tell you it is not ok to stay there !
room size and cleanliness were acceptable and so was was the continental breakfast .
the room smell made the stay uncomfortable .
in fact , it was awful .
i reluctantly accepted the response and scheduled my appointment .
they talked on the phone the next day and he was extremely rude .
they do n't care about anything except for your money .
and the second visit totally ruined my hair .
for sure will never ever go there again .
first , it 's very pricy .
it 's not worth the price .
after a few months , i gave a second try .
i went here to find out about wedding dress alterations .
i would not recommend .
she did n't know the warranty plans when i asked her .
even sold the wrong size ring to us after we tried it on .
i go here a lot because i live nearby .
also i wish the dim lighting and the weak espresso could be improved .
i guess i 'd try this place once more , just to be fair .
not really a fan .
$ _num_ for a pint of pasta salad ?
$ _num_ for a cup of yogurt with _num_ blueberries and some granola ?
i really would want to avoid this place because of the service .
every time i 've been here , they always get something wrong .
i just feel that the are n't very attentive .
ugh .
i dunno , new hire ?
for the listed reasons , the latte was given zero stars .
avoid until they get over themselves .
man was i disappointed by my experience here .
the woman said `` no i do n't need to run it again .
sadly .
however , it rang up as _num_ .
why should i bother shopping here ?
almost everything was well over $ _num_ per meal , even the staple stuff .
second problem : no leftovers .
first off , our waiter only understood about _num_ % of what we said .
he did n't understand and sent the manager over .
i cook thai food at home .
this was the must disgusting restaurant i have eaten at in years .
i was obviously disgusted and i told the waiter .
he ran away because he did n't want to deal with it .
i tried to get his attention but he was ignoring us !
also , the few bites of pad thai that i did have were awful .
not flavorful at all .
i will never be back .
very disappointed .
potato in the curry tasted like it was canned .
no authentic thai flavors .
bland and tasteless .
but eating there is just kind of depressing sometimes .
i wo n't be back .
this was the worst thai food i 've ever had !
they used canned mango for my mango and sticky rice dessert .
the chicken stays were microwaved .
this experience was very disappointing .
the older woman who started to serve me was not very nice at all .
warning check your credit cards and bill !
refused to refund fraud charges !
update : after _num_ months the credit card issue was resolved .
what 's worse ?
dont eat here unless you want a two month ordeal for fraud charges .
avoid this dirty horrible establishment at all costs !
the conversation with the owner was unbelievable , laughable at best .
she demanded to know what else we ate .
lived in _num_ e white st , champaign for half a year .
anyway , never resident in _num_ e white !
however , i am a very clean tenant and did all my cleaning .
if you are thinking of renting here ... do n't do it !
the apartments are not in good shape considering that they are fairly new .
it is sad how continually they are allowed to take advantage of their tenants .
the construction is getting ridiculous at this point .
this is not right .
it 's not fair .
i want my rent back .
this is ridiculous .
that 's just not right .
today is april _num_ , _num_ .
the apartment is a mess .
they do n't care about their tenants .
they , i quote , are `` dogs '' .
everything was ok after move in although the furnishings were dated and quite worn .
this unit is by far the worse unit you can possibly get yourself into .
the apartment itself was disgusting ' !
i fell sick the first week .
ca n't wait to move out of this company .
by far the worst place i ever loved at in my life .
they do not care at all about you .
i really do n't get what the big deal is with this place .
this place is over rated .
given all this , the $ _num_ entrees on the specials menu were surprising .
not so .
to top it off , service was poor .
you have been warned .
so , went here on a busy saturday night .
for burgers that cost around $ _num_ , i would expect a lot more .
it 's nothing special , neither good nor bad .
i tried it twice , it underwhelmed on both occasions .
the service was n't good .
poor beer , wine and food selection ( as in no selection ) .
tortilla chips come standard and it 's extra for fries ?
no pink in sight .
she may as well have said `` you 're not welcome here .
frankly , i 'm not sure when we will go back .
not so much .
im gon na sum this up quickly .
and i smell like a resturant !
wo n't go back nor will i suggest anyone go there .
horrible , maybe burgers are good , but i do not like being ignored .
the hostess is terribly rude and nasty .
the seating is horrible .
the last time i was there the food was good but really slow .
terrible customer service .
we walked in and asked for a table for two .
wait time .
something to drink ( even after ordering drinks it took over _num_ minutes ) .
nothing particularly good to say about the food .
it was fine , i guess , but why is it so expensive ?
location : kinda lousy , service : kinda lousy , food : kinda meh .
why bother ?
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
after our lunch both of us felt really bad .
never said a word never put down her phone .
worst service ever .
the worker over there is rude !
this place has the worst service ever .
worst place ever !
too expensive for what it is .
the ham was just awful and there was way too much cheese .
no bike rack , so brought bike in .
did not allow it and could not offer an alternative location .
usually go in car , but no more .
unlike the poster below i did n't find them particularly polite or apologetic .
unfortunately i also think that language is a barrier .
excessive grease is used .
also , avoid goin on the thursday nights .
they have a stupid live band .
however , as time went on , the food quality slowly started to slip .
no bread , no water , no hello , nothing .
however , too little , too late .
nothing of that is left , the memories barely .
of course , we expected a small piece of freshly cooked tuna .
my stomach did n't thank me .
bottom line : avoid like the plague .
bad .
you could n't pay me to go back .
i miss the old downtown champaign location .
my friend and i had the saffron risotto and it was horrible .
it was n't creamy , in fact , it was soupy and bland .
the shrimp was overcooked and tough .
worse , i could n't even taste a hint of saffron .
needless to say we were not impressed .
the pasta was of an unappetizing soft texture and the dish was overly greasy .
the prosciutto tasted more like salted pork .
their only redeeming feature was the crab cake appetizer .
the meal started with bread , olive oil , and cheese for the dipping .
for my appetizer , i chose the sausage in crust .
the small side of greens was nicely dressed but rather limp .
the latter was fine , the former was nothing special .
slowest service i 've ever had in my life .
the hostess was the one who helped us .
took _num_ minutes to get our food after we ordered .
spent _num_ hours in the place ... was n't even crowded .
we asked for a discount and what did we get ... _num_ % .
we saved _num_ dollars after spending _num_ hours of our time there .
the food is a pale ghost of its former self .
the pasta is often over cooked .
the sauces which used to be very special have become indifferent .
worst service i have ever received at a subway .
this is the worst subway in champaign-urbana !
it was not spicy and i had pepper jack cheese on it .
i will avoid this subway until they get this problem resolved .
night at _num_ pm to pick up a sandwich .
the place was empty .
the nice guy behind the counter told me they were out of tuna salad .
the whole attitude was bizarre .
well , it 's the next day and it looks like garbage .
there is no way that i can go to work with this .
avoid this dude at all costs .
the bar is dark and a little dusty .
the drinks are worth trying but it is not great .
so , i ca n't study or do research while in there .
not cool .
i miss this place .
not that that is a bad thing for college .
not worth it .
honestly i would never go back to this bar .
however , the place is pretty nasty .
even when you do get served , it appears everything is really expensive .
$ _num_ for a bottle of miller lite ?
loud , but good music ?
full of disrespectful and dirty kids .
and there is no way to get out of line either .
avoid !
oh , except this party also charges $ _num_ cover .
snobby and pretentious .
drinks are very weak .
too loud to hear anything .
not a fan , at all .
i effing hate this place .
all around sloppy .
extremely poor staff .
racist behavior .
i agree , quite likely the worst subway on the planet .
the employees do not care _num_ % about you , or your order .
it 's old technology and it needs to die .
but its too expensive .
one good thing is that the drinks are ridiculously cheap .
shots are $ _num_ , pitchers can be as low as $ _num_ .
the employees were incredibly rude and were just standing in the ladies room .
their food was typical and not memorable and the beer is only okay .
given the choice , i would choose other bars over joe 's .
no thank you .
the waitress , i know not her name , was incredibly rude and inattentive .
hello , rude waitress .
nobody tipped , and the food was lukewarm by the time she served us .
what a horrible waitress .
she really should be fired .
service was horrible from the start .
second biggest problem is that nothing comes out at the same time .
only _num_ waters came out , before the best _num_ .
also , between each visit from our waitress , there is a long wait .
only thing worth anything was their perfect onion rings .
it 's also unfortunate that their _num_ bud light draft special was broken .
if you really want to try this place come for half off burgers .
i 'm thoroughly disappointed .
needless to say we wo n't be back anytime soon .
one of the worst bars on campus .
like there are much worse things going on at this campus than this .
if your not _num_ do n't even bother showing up .
that sucks .
it can be good , it can be bad .
never attempt to order food for delivery from here .
it will take well over an hour and be ice cold and mushy .
there is much better sober food .
meh .
worse yet they keep very inconsistent hours when students are away .
horrible food , only slightly more mexican than taco bell .
also pretty much identical to chipotle , which might be slightly better .
not worth the price .
also the lines at lunchtime can be ridiculous , which is sad .
on top of that , their hours are all over the place .
never any lines to worry about here !
horrible .
and my lettuce was rotten , wilted and brown .
makes me wonder whether the meat is beyond its expiration date too .
an empty restaurant like qdoba speaks for itself .
i waited _num_ minutes and no one ever showed up to open the shop .
no phone call either .
wo n't be trying this place again .
scam artists , plain and simple .
this place is just alright .
she has a technique where the shots do not hurt too bad .
like many other reviewers , i have suffered some bad experiences at champaign dental .
i will avoid them all as well .
do n't trust this place .
i am glad i checked with another dentist first !
do not go to champaign dental !
it 's terrible .
convinced me i needed a cap , i did n't .
my first visit i went for normal x-ray and cleaning covered by insurance .
she proceeds to tell me that today 's visit is $ _num_ .
_num_ weeks later i 'm back to get the filling replaced .
she of course proceeds to charge me as if that phone called never happened .
i do n't even know where to begin .
probably at least _num_ years ago .
no braces needed .
no cavities .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
stay away from these money hungry thieves !
going to have records transferred elsewhere .
she made this clear _num_ times .
a desperate excuse ) .
horrible customer service and do not care about their patients .
i wish i can give zero star !
i should have read the reviews here before i went there for _num_ times .
rainbow garden is basically all talk and no walk .
go to peking garden instead .
i ate it because i was hungry .
there was hardly any flavor .
like really gross .
the other dish had no flavor really .
the crab rangoon were good though a little too cream cheesy .
probably not .
the service is rude here .
in short : food is decent but service is horrible .
it went smooth enough though , and my order came fast , within minutes .
i probably could have done better at home .
so disappointed .
the biggest problem is their service .
that was extremely rude and i was quite offended by it .
food was greasy as hell .
how do you mess up a fried rice ?
i ate it with my chopsticks .
this is a review for their sunday night trivia .
_num_ max per team ; you pick your team name .
there are breaks for bathroom etc .
it was bad .
it was really just pico de gallo with more cucumbers .
not a soup but more of a raw salsa with large chunks .
i hated this place .
i 'm still out $ _num_ to them , three days later .
i paid $ _num_ for two bottles of pbr at this point .
so , i 'm not too pleased with the place .
later my cleared bank statement says the jerk gave himself a $ _num_ tip !
that is not ok !
i 'm not .
and it 's loud .
it 's not though .
now i avoid it like that plague .
what the hell ?
some weird management decisions at this place .
my margarita tasted like orange juice ... no hint of a margarita : ( .
horrible experience !
not an honest business .
will not be returning .
bartender was super rude .
not kidding .
waitress could not tell us anything about the beers on tap .
she said she was n't a beer drinker .
hubby gave up and ordered scotch .
it was watery pico de gallo .
gross .
i can understand having a bad day , but that woman is just terrible .
the store itself is not the worst but it seems a little dirty .
in my opinion , make the trip to green onion instead .
the lady working this place is very ignorant and rude !
there 's nothing good in here .
go to other asian stores cause this one will waste your time .
the most gross place i 've ever stayed .
some of these were new & never before worn .
the van will not take you anywhere .
rooms not ready , manager rude and did not offer any sort of concession .
disappointing service .
the common areas were really filthy .
room layout dumb .
bathroom was _num_ x _num_ tops .
large room space just laid out terribly .
door is in the middle of the entry wall so very inefficient layout .
finish line , you stink .
to which ... i said , `` no .
it was like i was invisible , y'all .
i walked over .
worst shopping experience ever .
i was waiting someone to help me with some pick-up stuff .
the associates saw me waiting but just walking towards the other way .
seems like i am not the only one .
the store just sucks .
it was a saturday night , when the bar is super crowded .
anyway , you order your food to the bartenders .
i do n't like the idea .
the greek one was a disaster .
it was supposed to have sausage , but i could n't taste any .
a juicy pizza is not my favorite .
but it went to terrible after yesterday .
i went with two friends to have some drinks and pizza .
the dude listened to us and in short said , `` too bad !
terrible service !
not worth it one bit !
murphy 's pub , the blind pig , and others .
there is no personality .
i 'm not entirely sure why , as this makes an awkward eating experience .
these things had enough salt to turn lake michigan into a salt lake .
they were awful .
i would not go back at all .
shared fries , fried potstickers , pizza and chicken tenders .
either that or i was starving - probably the latter .
the server was a bit pushy and had an attitude .
she was out her damn mind yelling at us like she was crazy !
the way this woman acted was completely rude and unprofessional .
wish i could give this place _num_ stars .
yeah , it 's that bad .
i will not be coming back !
i have dietary restrictions and i need to be picky .
the salmon only cost $ _num_ and it was a fairly big portion .
the servers were nice but the atmosphere was too load .
i do n't know why i bothered trying a second time .
so my main complaint about the lunch dining experience is sanitation .
wash your hands if you still decide to go .
okay , that 's not a big deal .
i guess i 'm just not used to this feel .
will not return or recommend anyone else visits this establishment .
the food was average , nothing like what the other reviews here say .
we visited due to the outstanding yelp reviews , but were extremely disappointed .
if you like pizza bites , well heck , then dig in .
not only that , but food takes forever to come out .
just awful .
but of course , this also sounds like a pretty horrible idea .
i get home and they had charged me _num_ dollars .
epic fail on their part , last time i go to that dive .
but the pizza is much too small for the price .
just not cool .
lousy service !
difficult to do when there are no tables available .
hard to get service .
ordered a house salad w/ no cucumbers & no croutons .
salad # _num_ came out with no onions .
trying to flag down my server was difficult .
pizza came , it was ok , but crust was tough .
this place charges a fee of $ _num_ to do basically nothing .
they lost my plates in the mail .
the time it takes for them to process the paper work is ridiculous .
avoid !
looks like i 'll need to pick up a lawyer .
this place is ridiculous .
however it was such a disappointment .
i want to cry because my hair was so ugly !
not worth it .
horrible heating system .
actually i do not even want to give one start for this place .
such a bad place and such bad management .
have lived in apartment in so many states and they are the worst .
this place was a bit of a disappointment for me .
i was so incredibly disappointed .
their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box .
i ca n't help but feel this restaurant has fooled many .
i suppose the entire visit was lackluster .
i do n't see what all the fuss is about .
i lived in chicago for many years so maybe i 'm spoiled .
i waited for _num_ minutes even though i had a reservation .
all in all , not the greatest .
you 've been warned .
the atmosphere is great , but the food is too buttery and overpriced .
prix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu .
we left hungry , and shaking our heads .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
water was slow to be refilled .
table of _num_ , we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings .
water was slow to be refilled .
however , i was really disappointed with the our dinner .
my steak was n't very tender or all that flavorful .
my recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here .
it was a very unpleasant dinner .
a good restaurant is not just about food , but also about ambience .
the soup was also extremely salty .
the portions on the other hand ... ridiculous .
did n't knock my socks off .
we walked bye and the place was empty .
two tables total seated eating .
after _num_ people and much talking they sat us .
service was extremely slow .
not sure what they consider booked .
not worth the money .
also , i found the couscous bland .
best part was the hummus , which i was wishing they served more of .
goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp , but lacked seasoning .
i am not impressed with this place .
sure , we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar .
it took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered .
when the food arrived , it was alright .
it was okay food , just not as tasty as i 've had elsewhere .
sure , why not .
my friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her .
it tasted out right burnt to me .
she was sincere , it was just annoying .
i was n't impressed with the food , and somewhat unhappy with the service .
i do n't know if i would recommend this place .
completely flat .
it 's really not good .
bartender _num_ : what is going on here .
me : this tastes like corn syrup .
have you tried it .
it 's not like we can serve it to someone else .
it would be different if there was something wrong with it .
but sure enough , _num_ minutes later all our food arrives at once .
that 's a shame .
oh radio maria , how i wish we could be in love .
you have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved ?
ok , i 'll bite .
sure , i do n't mind that this one has food spilled on it .
the sangria here is awful .
the food is greasy and not in a good way .
the only thing good was the goat cheese .
but it is goat cheese .
how can you mess that up ?
but , i think the tapas side is just terrible .
the biggest issue was that we were served the spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold .
not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend !
not me !
my problem is i remember how much better it once was .
the staff always act like you 're wasting their time .
my first disappointment was in the size of the menu .
awful place .
the potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland .
overall i left that place with $ _num_ less and still hungry .
not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment .
the only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks .
pity to see an old favorite fall this far .
my husband and i recently ate at radio maria for dinner .
on a friday afternoon , i was one of six sitting at the bar .
i have tried radio maria on visits to cu .
lunch on one trip was nothing short of inedible .
dinner one night was nice but over priced .
the food seems uninspired and the quality of ingredients is average .
i am giving this restaurant _num_ stars .
i do n't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment .
the food we ordered which was on a nearby table , was also covered .
worse yet , the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate .
the deep fried house potatoes were delish .
however , the service we got was unacceptable .
fill our water glasses ) , etc .
the restaurant is also extremely noisy .
it was very tough and he said it was inedible .
the food was awful .
you could smell and taste the garlic in everything .
the service was incredibly slow .
after the wait i was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver .
eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing .
it was stiff and hard to chew .
this is unbelievable .
will definitely not be recommending this establishment to anyone .
we ordered _num_ tapas to split between us .
had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict .
i also tried their caprese omelet and it was too garlicky .
i would n't go there for their brunch .
just got up and walked out on mother 's day .
reservation does n't mean you are getting a seat !
does she not know what the word reservation mean ?
i 've eaten here on average of around eight times a year since _num_ .
some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard .
a vanilla cream sauce does n't complement goat cheese , for example .
it is n't interesting .
it 's just kind of awful .
the worse store ever in costumer service !
crystal is the worse !
it is usually pretty empty , lunch or dinner time .
the falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour .
maybe i should try the shwarma instead .
the quality of the food is inconsistent .
the guy who works there seems very stressed and angry .
rest of food being mediocre .
just not worth going !
menu on yelp states lentil soup is made with olive oil .
there will be no soup for me here !
i would n't get it again .
overall , i was disappointed having spent almost $ .
this place was way worse than what i expected .
we ended up paying $ _num_ for _num_ people without any drinks .
i 'm never coming back to this place .
overpriced for a small portion and bland .
my mistake .
there was also a cigarette burn in my blanket .
the manager just charged me for one day , but it was horrible !
low price was the main attraction .
place was noisy , and needs complete renovation .
manager was sarcastic , toward any complaints .
there was no refrigerator , microwave , or breakfast .
do n't even bother .
the rate may be cheap but it 's still too much .
there was even a bug smashed and stuck on the wall .
i ca n't believe housekeeping would even consider this clean .
_num_ stars for being gross .
like sketchy gross .
not worth the value .
front desk staff is friendly but otherwise this place is a complete bust .
dirty room , rude staff , overpriced .
sleep in the park ; it 's cleaner .
that 's coming from a _num_ yr old , and we all agreed .
also , garbage was overflowing in the breakfast area .
tv was old - not a flat screen .
the hotel is filthy and not taken care of .
the staff and management is even worse .
worst decision you could make !
and do n't forget rude staff , that was the cherry on top !
sleep in your car , you 'll have a better experience .
my mom and i stayed here for _num_ nights .
if i could rate this as a negative _num_ star i would .
we stayed only one night here .
we would not visit here again .
i checked in , walked down to my room , and let myself in .
this was an improvement .
i go down , and yes , it 's better looking .
there 's no toilet seat !
it 's broken off and thrown under the sink .
this room is fine , he says .
i go down to the room , and it passes my quick inspection .
twenty minutes later , i realize the room is no warmer .
i check the heating unit and it 's blowing cold air .
this place is a hell hole .
one star only because zero stars is not an option .
this hotel is dirty and smells bad .
management is friendly but everything needs cleaned .
the pool , the hallways , the bathrooms .
did n't dare even try the free breakfast .
do n't use this company .
also technician accidentally dropped a bunch of chemicals in our yard in a pile .
a lot of chemicals in one pile results in dead grass .
never ever use this company .
worse , communication with this company is a nightmare .
someone at the company is making the application record up or cooking the book .
selection a bit limited and noisy when busy .
wait , restaurant ... cook my own food ?
the prices are absolutely ridiculous .
the salad bar was very poor .
very limited selection , and the food looked old and wilted .
still , our waitress was never around .
not a good sign for the quality of food to say the least .
all and all , i wo n't be going back here .
cheap meat , crap salad bar , just awful .
very sad .
we were sadly very disappointed .
the steak itself was nothing special and for a fillet it was pretty fatty .
the place is outdated and dirty .
the food was awful .
the steaks had no flavor and were chewy .
i would not recommend .
i can make a better steak at home for half the price .
waste of time .
there were _num_ in our party .
it was an ok experience .
i guess i am not in a huge hurry to go back .
the disappointing aspect was that the steaks were so bland .
the baked potato was actually really good yet the salad bar was nothing special .
the place seemed okay but was dirty and the lighting was terrible imho .
probably would n't go back .
service , worse every visit .
additionally , the topping options got the baked potato was lacking .
steak was under cook .
wait for _num_ minutes .
and never see my sever again .
i give _num_ star cuz chef bring steak back to me .
if not , i wo n't give any thing .
just driving through the area and had to stop for the night .
the decor made me think it would be much more affordable than it was .
i mean , vinyl tablecloths at a steakhouse ?
no steak for me .
i ate 1/2 of the serving and left the rest .
they were gummy and flavorless .
the salad bar was unremarkable , but not bad .
in my mind a reservation at _num_ means you get seated around _num_ .
why not seat people at those tables ?
it was just super chaotic and unprofessional .
no you did n't .
we should 've just gone there to begin with .
i had not been here for several years .
way too expensive for what you get .
my meal was $ _num_ for a fillet they cook .
the meat was fine the salad bar was empty there had been _num_ buses .
$ _num_ for half a glass of wine .
their salesperson is too pushy and followed up around .
carpet is too expensive compared to other places .
it 's normally really dirty in there too.
where in this list do you see peanuts ?
actually , i guess that is what i 'm saying .
shit never went down like that in california .
overpriced and bland .
if i closed my eyes i would n't be able to tell them apart .
the only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate .
otherwise , save your money and your time and just go somewhere else .
it did not live up to all the fuss .
they guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing .
even then it took forever for our order to be made .
on the other hand , i ended up literally drinking it .
i have nothing against this custard place .
however , in my humble fat opinion , custard sucks .
it is just not that good of a dairy dessert .
anyway , not my thing .
absurd wait time .
no business this inefficient should be around .
the service is so slow it 's ridiculous .
it 's an okay product but the service is unbearable .
the owners could n't care less that there far better ways to do things .
hire _num_ more people .
one person , takes orders and money , another makes the order .
the time would be cut b _num_ % .
it takes way to long to get through the line .
long wait for ok ice cream .
if i had to imagine the most depressing place it is here .
we did not have a good experience there .
i have received poor service from this kfc location many times .
ranging from no napkins at the drive-thru ( a big pet peeve of mine !
gross ! )
ridiculous they are that slow .
the fries had a stale chemical taste .
terrible .
amazingly , worse than i expected .
worst .
i hate chain restaurants .
every time i 've been here , i 've been unsatisfied .
my last experience here was my worst .
waited in the drive thru for _num_ minutes as the only car .
if it were only me , i would have laughed and drove away .
certainly not convenient , cheap , or tasty .
i do n't believe any positive reviews came from actual customers .
worst kfc experience ever !
instead of two meals they only had one .
i gave my order again two more times , each time slowly .
this place is really bad !
and you forgot the lettuce and the tomatoes are tasteless .
terrible terrible employees , worst customer service i 've received in a while .
slow service .
meanwhile my sandwich is just sitting there on the counter .
next time i should go to jimmy johns .
very poor customer service here , especially displayed by store manager angela .
i 'm the customer standing here ready to make a purchase .
the pizza was n't horrible , but the deal was awful .
low rating is for price vs. quality , and value .
way too greasy , and it was definitely stale , old grease .
ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad .
cheese only was edible , but anything we had with toppings was bad .
worst customer service ever !
the manager jason is very rude and does n't take ownership for his mistakes .
this one i on the worst list .
but service is lacking big time .
not a single smile or hello when we walked in the door .
i would give them a zero if i could .
the manager hung up on me when i was trying to report an issue .
worst service ever .
what a way to make it right , wrong !
u could tell the guy who answered the phone was pissed off .
no thanks !
worst manager experience ever !
would n't give us our total for delivery .
duh the pizza was great but this manager should n't work with the public .
when i received my ready to pick up prompt , i drove over .
only pizza was ready .
i arrived home and the pizza was still wrong .
needless to say our dinner was ruined .
th fish was over cooked .
only eat here if you are stuck in this building and pressed for time .
horrible .
lots of angry people were getting out of their cars to investigate .
ridiculous .
unprofessional rude staff .
did n't even go hang around the under _num_ section downstairs .
just kidding , i would never do that .
do n't waste your night there !
$ _num_ cover , no hats , and they steal your id .
how is this garbage still in business ?
i bit my tongue .
this place is a joke .
call me crazy but is n't there anywhere in phoenix to dance .
the staff was so rude !
1st door guy said we could come in for free anytime fri night .
the place was ghetto and empty .
sorry sky lounge , you suck .
expired and bad .
same thing .
terrible service .
do n't get beer here .
_num_ star is more than this place deserves .
the staff was horrible .
i would never go back to this place again .
today is monday and i am still sick .
i would give zero stars if it were an option .
if i could give this place zero stars , i would .
that 's got to be the most annoying shit ever !
both times the place was dead .
omg , i 'm sooooo sad .
i 'm such an individual i need to look like everyone else ... .
absolutely horrible place !
these guys deserve better than that .
every time i have been , the bar has been understaffed .
it 's almost as if this is a bare bones establishment .
and certainly not $ _num_ for a ten minute inspection .
not a great way to build a relationship .
and these guys totally failed .
hours it takes to swap them out ?
still not good enough .
i know a little something about cars .
my uncle has been a mechanic for over _num_ years .
i took my car to virginia auto service for a very specific issue .
they called me with a totally different problem the cost to fix was outrageous .
i repeated what i needed and they told me no , no , no .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
i had already changed the fuel filter .
i 'm not sure how much these guys know about anything .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
chuck 's speed shop did my block work @ $ _num_ .
i had already changed the fuel filter .
i 'm not sure how much these guys know about anything .
their shop rate is $ _num_ .
i was not impressed once .
no spice .
no life .
no business from me .
recently went back with a party of _num_ for a bday celebration .
it was only downhill from there .
_num_ min to get drink orders , another _num_ to get the drinks .
another _num_ min later he took our food orders .
_num_ min later they started coming out , sort of .
do n't think i 'll go back to dine in - ever .
bad choice .
that said , i must admit that the fried banana dessert was delicious !
the waitress could have been quite a bit more attentive .
you ca n't take care of takeout and dining customers ?
customer service at it 's worst !
service was the worst i have ever experienced .
i have n't and will not go back .
the lady on the phone said it was not an issue .
the hostess said it would be _num_ minutes for a table .
literally two seconds later , there was a four person table cleared .
the place was busy and noisy .
the menu was limited and average priced for most items .
the hubby had the bbq chicken with coconut rice .
so sadly we will not be returning .
very mediocre .
after no response , i went in ordered food .
food was delivered _num_ minutes later .
then adding insult to injury the food was bland when it arrived .
not worth the time or money solid _num_ stars .
mediocre thai food .
nothing bad but nothing special .
it was mostly broth with few veggies .
the green papaya salad was bland needing more lime juice .
disappointing experience .
the cheesy _num_ 's radio station did n't help .
as soon as she entered she was met by a thai staff member .
what is up with crappy customer service in this town ?
his response , `` ohhh sorry !
i could n't believe it .
i got charged $ _num_ for a dish we could n't even eat .
totally lame .
a manager did n't even come over to try to smooth this issue out .
i left nothing for the tip considering they were ok to rip me off .
i wo n't be back .
my wife and i were very excited to try this place based on reviews .
the staff was very nice , but a little slow it seemed .
my wife told me that her seafood panang was relatively bland .
no offer to refund the meal was offered .
very disappointing .
a few other issues with service but minor compared to routine food poisoning .
the manager refunded my entire tip in cash .
have n't been back and will likely never return .
unfortunately the service was absolutely appalling .
she took even longer to collect the bill and run our card .
extremely disappointed with my experience and i will not be coming back .
there were only three couples inside including us .
the service was unacceptable .
from the moment my friend and i entered the restaurant the experience was bad .
it took a long time for us to get water or our drinks .
impossible .
eventually our entrees came , i ordered soup , it was n't good .
it was almost impossible to manage .
then our check came , he overcharged us .
the restaurant was not busy , it was typical for a wednesday night .
there is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness .
really disappointed - place is not as good as it used to be .
the hostess was nowhere to be seen .
ten minutes pass .
no sign of the hostess .
other people have arrived and walked out as well .
maybe they 'd get one of the still empty tables .
that girl probably just cost the restaurant thousands in future business .
when the dish came out , i was so disappointed .
$ _num_ extra for two shrimps !
we were told it would be about _num_ mins .
do n't expect customer service !
if you ca n't handle the heat , then get out of the kitchen !
i could n't believe what i was hearing !
we left the restaurant and i will never return .
big fat f for this place .
the flavors and preparation is just not authentic .
disgrace .
needless to say , this was very disappointing .
two stars for service and cleanliness alone , none for food .
the food was fine but the service was atrocious .
we flagged down another employee who got the waiter .
really , where were all the servers ?
it was also disappointing to me that the bill was not clear .
they would do well to make the customer feel a little more welcoming .
the basil chicken was not much better .
watery sauce and minimal flavoring .
so , this place was my absolute favorite thai restaurant in phoenix until today .
she did n't even eat it !
we waited _num_ minutes for our food .
the wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off .
it was n't busy at all , but our server was not very attentive .
a large group would not use any of these open tables .
instead my time was wasted .
i could see the owner busy cooking in the kitchen .
i would suggest she spend a little more time on the front .
why are n't you tasting the food that your cooks are putting out ?
pad thai was terrible ... very salty , not sweet at all .
i could n't believe my eyes .
two stars today for a very poor meal last night .
its not that great .
the chicken pad thai is pretty decent , but i have had better .
my second trip here was not great at all .
it was a piss poor excuse and they were n't that apologetic .
sadly .
will not be going back .
it seems like every time we come here there 's a line .
you decide which is more important .
for me , there are plenty of better thai places in the area .
but the service is so bad that it hardly makes up for it .
so we walk in , it 's not very busy .
she looked at me like i said something foreign and refused and said no .
she did n't answer , gave me a dirty look and we walked out .
i 've never experienced anything like that .
absolute horrendous customer service .
in _num_ degree heat , we were refused .
even more , i am disappointed that the staff behavior was so appalling .
the food is terrible .
pad thai is mediocre at best .
the peanut sauce is more like gravy then sauce , thick and gritty .
over all it was a poor experience .
two waitresses ignored us , one cleaning a table that was obviously not needed .
she said she would get a hostess .
terrible service !
cold .
terrible service !
waited _num_ min for a cold dinner .
poor table service !
we went on a saturday night and there were plenty of tables available .
ca n't complain about the chicken pad thai because it was great .
i ordered chicken pad thai .
it was mediocre and the service was bad .
when i asked her for chopsticks , she just walked away .
only because i ca n't give them _num_ stars .
they really need to get it together .
supposedly they do not take reservations , but they were unable to seat us .
i left barely eating the dish .
not worth taking anything home .
went there with a group i 'm in .
gross !
disappointing to say the least !
poorly handled from start to finish .
too bad , because i 've heard good things about this place .
i 'm disappointed .
the rice was n't fresh .
but over all i 'll most likely not go here again .
service was terrible !
we drove _num_ hours from sedona to eat here .
total of _num_ people together .
our disappointment is in how the wait staff was directed to assist the customer .
poor service .
waitress was rude and avoided my inquire of service .
i had to wait _num_ minutes to get food .
i wo n't be back .
my husband got the worst haircut ever today from jackie .
very misleading and deceptive .
oh well take my business elsewhere .
not worth driving _num_ minutes for this type of treatment .
first of all , this is horrible advice .
there were two things that really bothered me about my appointment .
i will not go back here again .
i 'm very disappointed .
i am _num_ years old .
i do not recommend central phoenix !
my experience was terrible .
her reply , `` yup , i do n't know what to tell you .
unbelievable .
never , ever have i been so appalled .
i rescheduled but after this i plan to never go back .
thank you for your reply to this _num_ months later .
so glad this nightmare is behind me .
keep in mind , this was the 1st time i had met her .
just know that your patients surely do miss you .
the buffet was smaller than most but that was n't a big deal .
the problem was the dry and hard food .
the beds were comfortable .
they have a pool , a jacuzzi , and a workout room .
the staff is n't so great .
it was a roof over our heads .
it is not a great hotel .
on top of that the pull out bed was uncomfortable as hell !
stupid short bed .
it 's been robbed on _num_ different occasions while i was shopping there .
( he would n't run his store safeway card for me ! )
their change machine was down for well over a week !
`` hello , did you find everything you are looking for today ? ''
`` oh , sorry too here that . ''
`` no , just seeing if you need assistance . ''
the cashier 's are often super slow and not very friendly .
seems like half the time i go there they do n't have it .
it was really rude and unprofessional .
another thing , the starbucks thing is ridiculous .
did we really need another one ?
it pains me to say , this safeway is horrible .
does n't corporate come by every once and a while ?
every time i go , they 're out of something .
i '' m talking basics .
bread , milk , soda .
it is atrocious .
not anymore .
i just do n't ever recall that a sandwich required silverware .
the time prior , i went and they were out of tomatoes .
walk over to the produce and pick up a tomato !
`` no !
but sadly , it 's the closest store to my downtown office .
this safeway is ghetto ... for arizona .
none of the employees are helpful nor friendly .
the products are all grossly overpriced .
this is a terrible location .
very random and sketchy .
the huge problem here , is everything else .
it makes for an unsafe situation for everyone .
it really seems like this store just does n't give a shit .
at each opportunity to impress , the complete opposite happens .
the last time was my last time ever walking into either safeway store .
i do n't know how they get away with selling moldy fruits and vegetables .
can i give this _num_ stars ?
i am so disappointed in this safeway and will not return .
i hate this safeway .
there are never enough cashiers .
i could n't believe it .
nothing worse than you 'd find in the sf bay area .
quit being so stuck up .
hands down worst safeway in phx !
this is the worst staffed safeway in the valley .
it 's that bad .
_num_ ) what carts you ask ?
yes , only two , despite there being _num_ or _num_ total checkout lanes .
oh , and there may or may not be trash on the floor .
on top of it all customer service was rude .
bad experience all around !
_num_ out of _num_ times , i am overcharged .
on my last _num_ visits it was for over $ _num_ .
unfortunately , this safeway is a few blocks from my house .
we all have bad days .
as i looked up , i noticed the _num_ items or less sign .
i apologized and was only met with more attitude .
there were _num_ .
what the hell is that smell inside the store ?
this probably the worst grocery store i 've ever been to .
the way he responded gave me a sour feeling about the customer service .
but it seems to be quite busy .
checking out sucks so much .
got overcharged , after a few minutes got so mad i left .
keep the $ _num_ , y'all need it more than me !
pathetic at best .
the third negative was that most of the food was not good at all .
not good .
they brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas .
overall , food was bad .
did i mention they did n't give us silverware ?
went here for dinner with a group of _num_ .
too extreme for me .
not too bad , not great either .
sorry sam 's but this will be my first and last time .
as it turned our , i should have listened to my stomach .
ca n't beat that ... except maybe with a couple of rounds of patron .
not as good as i had hoped .
strange menu : pasta , but no burritos .
had the chicken quesadilla , and did n't care much for it .
the only good thing was the chips ... not going back .
minus : way too salty .
everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable .
without cilantro and he still said no .
it was really a terrible experience .
nasty .
my stomach hurts .
absolutely the worst service i 've ever seen .
they had no flavor , and the tortillas were hard .
poor form .
very disappointing .
poor service , we actually had to get our menus ourselves .
not a good experience - go somewhere else .
the food is mediocre .
five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what i ordered .
... ... ... .
this place is a headache .
it looks like something i could have created using visual basic in high school .
_num_ stars only because of the margaritas .
positives :
because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up .
not one , but two roaches crawling on the table .
and the energy is not good , very off !
would n't recommend eating here !
the service was slow waitress did not know the menu or the ingredients .
how very disappointing .
but that is not going to be enough to win back the meal .
ate there last night for one reason , the fabulous location .
i think our server was just too busy with three other relatively big tables .
she was helpful and asked if she could get us anything else .
just too many other good places in the area to eat .
staff was rude and obnoxious .
also , they close very early no matter what their hours say .
most likely will not be back .
group decision , not a personal preference to return .
first thing , both nights , the service was extremely slow .
i had the chicken fajitas night _num_ .
the chicken was really dry and had an abundance of unnecessary seasoning on it .
drinks were week , and service at the bar was terrible .
seriously , not worth your time .
not happy at all and definitely not coming back .
even to get our waters took a long time .
i was definitely not impressed at all .
aside for my plate taking _num_ minutes to get served , it was cold .
that first round was really weak , by the way .
chicken ?
wo n't be back .
the food was mainly cold and the steak fajitas were rubbery .
ummm ... in a word , no !
taste was lackluster .
if there was i could n't taste it .
no cheddar cheese , no guacamole , no beans .
bill was $ _num_ , which i thought was fair .
long wait with super rude host .
terrible service - period .
i 'm not the server ; i 'm the paying patron .
they closed early and are not reliable .
never going back .
we were a group of _num_ for dinner our poor waiter had no help .
the food was terrible !
i treated my mom and aunt to lunch .
the wings were ok , pretty greasy & nothing spectacular .
not very busy on a monday night .
a table of _num_ hungry guys did n't finish either appetizer .
sadly , canyon cafe just does n't cut it .
my coworker got the ahi tuna southwestern salad and he rated it 4/5 stars .
the crust was tasty but i hardly ate any of the cake itself .
i probably wo n't be back .
we even had a hard time getting our check so we could leave .
mediocre food .
mediocre service .
food was great , sw cobb salad is amazing but the service was horrible .
$ _num_ salad , i can get that somewhere else with much better service .
we were not greeting with a warm welcome .
the hostess was very rude to me and the others in my party .
we waited another _num_ minutes for those .
the teeter house is a trip , like no other .
it took _num_ hour for everybody to get their food .
and the room temperature needed some adjustment for a phoenix summer day .
not my cup of tea !
no plates at first , the tea was nothing to write home about .
the scones a bit dry and the jam , maybe walmart strawberry .
the worst was the dessert .
everything manages to have a bitter taste that i just can not explain .
still the place is usually crowded .
what 's worse is they 're usually rude about it .
lastly , they do n't honor coupons the correct way .
but has a problem with someone buying someone food when they are hungry .
shame shame !
now it will be another _num_ years before through a drive through again .
please check your order before you leave the driver through window .
you may well find they have charged you for warmed over garbage .
this place does so-so to the max .
over-priced , small portions , mediocre service .
this one might be among the worst i have seen .
it 's okay .
oh for the love of god this place is boring .
and there seems to be interactive things for kids too !
i like a lot of museums in phoenix .
the place was insanely overcrowded for the small space .
it did n't begin at 5:30 like we were informed .
the margaritas were too strong to enjoy .
so you ate and that was it .
i was expecting more , so i was disappointed .
extremely disappointed in this museum .
let 's start with positives ...
- concessions , a dumpy little espresso kiosk ?
i have a feeling , that these folks , are volunteers .
i did n't know they were n't the same as the other seats .
these seats are very uncomfortable !
the ladies bathroom is pretty and clean but was designed terrible .
however , i was terribly disappointed with the seating .
this , to me , was not necessary .
ridiculous .
it 's cheap , it 's fast , the name is familiar ?
i once went _num_ years without eating at a taco bell .
why did i try it again ?
the set up is terrible .
avoid like the plague .
- the place was total sausage fest .
like _num_ dudes to one girl .
- worst fish and chips imaginable .
- hot wings , surprisingly , we 're okay .
- philly cheesesteak sandwich - ick .
- cole slaw , more like sugar slaw .
vote elsewhere .
$ _num_ just is n't worth it though .
i assumed she was going to get silverware .
but then i did n't see her again until she brought the hamburger .
there were so many things wrong at this time .
especially seeing that i have _num_ children under the age of _num_ .
there was nothing on it .
she just brought over the hamburger on one plate with no extras .
at this point i was so annoyed and tired and wanted to leave .
i did n't even want to bother complaining and waiting to get more food .
after a long day , i just wanted to leave .
but i would never come back again .
my meal was not put in the system .
i 'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews .
probably not .
it 's not like they were busy .
we just left and went to hard rock cafe .
the atmosphere is not casual and the place is not very inviting .
the hostess was not friendly and neither was the staff inside .
ive never had even mediocre service there .
everyone looked like they were working hard to make everyone happy .
the food was gross .
drinks are cheap .
here 's the downfall .
food did n't look appetizing .
would n't be surprised .
i would stay away from there drink specials .
it may be cheap but thats because there 's no alcohol !
with the shot it came out to $ _num_ .
they ordered another drink special in hopes it would be better .
fail .
sad to say but they returned it .
ridiculous expensive drink prices ... $ _num_ for a double tall vodka soda .
needless to say i was so disappointed .
wow , what a disappointment !
i was not impressed with this place .
like i said , i expected more out of this place and left disappointed .
good place to watch a game but the food is terrible .
that did not sit well with me .
another issues i had with this place was the dj .
he came over and introduced himself as the dj from chicago .
he was by far the worst dj i have ever heard .
lastly , the drinks were watered down .
very mediocre food when surrounded by a lot of great options .
it 's not .
my chicken sandwich was dry and uninspired .
the one thing that stood out was the chunky bleu cheese dressing .
otherwise , do n't see myself coming back .
lame . ''
and ... my vodka soda tasted like water .
ordered a caesar salad with grilled shrimp and a side of avocado .
the service was attentive , but not overbearing .
stopped in for a bite to eat before catching a game at chase stadium .
very disappointed .
the service was terrible .
worst experience as a mom ever !
he apologized for the error and waited on us the rest of the visit .
we would not go back .
overpriced tasteless food with a poor beer selection .
the service was ok too , but it was n't busy at all .
boy was i wrong !
i ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado .
nothing more , nothing less .
tried some chips and salsa too .
no need to return ever again .
not on my list for a quick return .
sitting outside is nice but the speakers are annoying .
worst experience ever !
just how long does it take to cook _num_ burgers ?
after _num_ more minutes , we decided to leave .
the server came to me `` why did n't you wait _num_ more minutes ?
pathetic and unprofessional .
huge disappointment !
ordered _num_ burgers medium .
they came out extremely well done & the buns were hard & dry .
they did n't even send a manager over .
$ _num_ for an inedible meal .
we will not be back .
it was good but overcooked by two levels .
too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location .
i may not be back .
nachos are chips with taco bell meat and obvious nacho cheese from a pump .
the beer selection is weak at best .
noisy and the atmosphere is more dive bar than lounge .
will avoid in the future .
worst service i 've ever had ( literally ) .
spent $ _num_ at the bar and it never got any better .
just an overall terrible experience .
the milk was bad !
there was no doubt it was well beyond its expiration date .
it was everything i could do not to get sick .
like where they serve it from should change my perspective .
the manager brought out our food and never addressed the rotten milk .
it was awful .
the beef was rubbery and had an off flavor .
the au jus was flavorless .
it was good but nothing worth going crazy over .
my biggest complaint with this restaurant was the service .
when we arrived , we told the hostess that there _num_ of us .
it just rubbed me the wrong way .
not much flavor and a dry bun .
the reason for the low rating vs average was because of _num_ things .
that is just gross .
they brought them to me very quickly .
i ordered the brownie to-go for desert ... what a waste of money .
server took almost _num_ minutes to come to table then blamed it on hostess .
who does n't have slaw with a reuben .
also , no kosher pickle .
in fact , no pickle .
went in on a very slow wednesday night .
the place was fully staffed , though , no one wanted to acknowledge us .
the experience itself was awful !
however , the cocktails are served with little or no pour .
she did n't check on refills .
the menu is kinda bad , they need more of a selection !
the roll they use for the burgers are awful !
called to make sure they could change my watch battery .
there was nothing going on inside .
friendly ... yea but my watch still does n't work .
this is why the mall gets all the business .
that the cab is still _num_ miles away !
is there a way to give zero stars ?
okay , that 's annoying but hardly the beginning of it .
i live about _num_ miles from the airport .
when i got to my apt , i called the company to complain .
the first person i spoke to was very understanding and apologetic for my experience .
absolutely one of the worst cab companies imaginable .
i will go out of my way to never use them again .
i called another cab company immediately afterwards and had absolutely no problem with them .
never calling yellow cab again .
_num_ minutes ago was told _num_ minutes .
dispatch informed someone would arrive .
i stated that was not acceptable as i had a flight to catch .
this is the worst cab service i ever experienced .
after waiting for a few minutes , i lady picked up .
i wish the company can find out who this lady was .
the site gave me a confirmation number .
the operator said she could n't get the cabs to answer them .
i would not recommend this company .
the problem seems to be from the supervisor down .
they will not take care of you if you call them with a complaint .
you do not get to speak to a manager .
they refuse to come to the phone .
can i give these guys zero stars ?
the driver ripped me off !
why would we need to see indian school road two times ?
it sure wo n't be yellow cab .
the worst customer service i have experienced in my life .
driver was very rude .
he was very angry that i did not know the direction .
he was very rude .
this is the worst cab company in whole world .
way too many fucking issues .
i said no because im already late enough because of your company .
he doesnt fucking understand i dont have time .
my recommendation is to dump this company and find other cab service companies .
i would give them a negative star if possible .
yellow cab taxi is rip off !
i have zero bad things to say about any of the drivers .
they made me feel like an idiot and that is terrible customer service .
i 'm very disappointed with the customer service at yellow cab .
worst experience ever !
i would n't recommend them to , my worst enemy .
horrible .
he refused for us to pay with a credit card .
i got out of the car to get my bags .
i will never use yellow cab again .
very poor customer service .
the operator said it was _num_ mins .
beyond frustrating !
i get downstairs in _num_ minutes .
the security guard at the front door tells me the cab just left .
i wait for another _num_ minutes .
it 's now past my original reservation time .
no apologies for the confusion , no explanation .
rates to the airport are a different rate than `` street rates '' .
i tell him i 'm not paying double the quoted rate .
he refuses to switch it .
what a train wreck .
called to ask for an additional van , were told _num_ minutes .
waited for that , called back , and a van was not available still !
avoid yellow cab like the plague .
you guys wonder why everyone is switching to uber ?
it was a mistake .
i was craving pizza .
i do not recommend .
the food is ok , nothing special but not bad .
i tried the asian , garlic buffalo and sam adams bbq .
it was all down hill from there though .
skip it !
after my last visit ( my 4th to this location ) , i quit .
perhaps i just had a bad room .
but i can name a few bad ones !
rooms and bathrooms are small .
not much privacy !
happened about once every _num_ seconds .
no control over ac : i know it 's phoenix , but come on .
overall opinion : not worth the money .
for a few bucks more i could have stayed at the hyatt or something .
will probably not be staying here again the next time i 'm in town .
not so rad .
management was horrible .
the valet did n't have a name tag .
no hot water in the morning .
gross .
sorry hotel san carlos .
while you are a charming little old hotel , you 're not for me .
so , do n't stay here if you have options .
the bar was okay but the comedy show was horrible .
on the other hand , the valet attendant exceeded my expectations .
he was very personable and helpful .
i was not pleased to hear this .
that 's just my fault .
hated it !
maybe snap your fingers too .
unfortunately , when that day arrived i was severely disappointed .
that 's the problem .
it 's just old and crappy , not historic and charming .
the king bed we upgraded to was just two small beds pushed together .
want a late checkout , no problem ... oh , wait , problem .
the night person and the morning person seem to be on different pages .
( yes , that is a legit excuse . )
( for me , not the hotel staff . )
no security at all , just a young girl behind the front desk .
the worst part is the `` manager '' .
this hotel was awful .
no hot water ( are you kidding ?
no coffee onsite , the closest was starbucks down a few blocks .
this is not worth your money or time , trust me !
small room facing the main street ( quiet though ) .
do not stay here .
no ac - this is phoenix !
the only positive was the roof deck with the pool .
next time i would stay at a nearby hotel from a national chain .
they hold an extra $ _num_ on your card in case of room damage .
it was saturday night and the dance floor was empty .
there was a somewhat weird vibe about the place but nothing really standing out .
i will probably avoid going here again , including the club .
if there was a zero star it would be more appropriate .
made a reservation through hotels.com for $ _num_ for one night stay .
finally the host comes out with the worst attitude ever .
she also wo n't call me back .
entire lack of professionalism and courtesy .
gross , just gross .
the bathroom we had was so small i was worried about getting stuck !
my mother 's room had no hair dryer or working outlet in the bathroom .
it was none less disappointing and not worth the price .
i stayed at this hotel for a conference and it was terrible !
this hotel is horrible !
i paid _num_ for one night and regret it !
i 've stayed at motel _num_ that are way better than this !
people at front desk are not friendly , borderline rude .
i really was n't impressed and i would n't stay there again .
nothing like waiting until the last minute to clean it up !
ok , now the bad part .
that 's how thin the walls are btw .
_num_ stars .
unfortunately , we were fairly disappointed .
however , we wo n't be going again .
i could n't leave fast enough - a completely disappointing experience .
the hotel also claimed to have room service and cable .
gross old hotel - not charming in any way .
the decor of the rooms is n't just dated it is downright tired .
the furniture was chipped and the walls were dingy .
at home i 'm used to a cramped _num_ year old bathroom .
when i called to correct the billing the manager was incredibly rude and unhelpful .
on top of this the front desk was rude when questioned about the billing .
again , poor management and customer service .
the hotel san carlos does not do that .
we are not talking shabby chic .
there is no customer service here .
i booked it because it was cheap .
and kinda gross .
horrible .
at least it does n't try to be what it 's not .
the price was not worth the product .
very few outlets so tough to charge up computers and phones .
none in the bathroom !
so i had to blow my hair dry in the other room .
the bathroom had a huge sink but zero counter space .
no counter in the bathroom .
the tv volume was not working and the picture was terrible .
as others have posted , the walls are quite thin .
the valet drives up in his personal car .
unfortunately , this is the worst hotel that i 've ever stayed in .
the walls are thin .
for $ _num_ per night , they should be ashamed .
there is no room service .
internet is very spotty and makes working incredibly frustrating .
not impressed .
the hotel room was not particularly clean and it was really out of date .
the room was _num_ a night .
the pool was ice cold .
why would it even be off ?
they had water bottles in the room for _num_ a bottle .
you should not have to pay that but you had no other option .
she should only charge me like a $ _num_ .
she would not give us a discount .
very rude !
she took _num_ off for valet .
way too expensive for what you get and not worth it !
single worst experience i 've ever had at a hotel .
and suggested i spend more money to have another girl wax these areas .
worst pedicure ever .
absolutely horrible experience .
do not get jessica .
but i did n't need anything else done .
i 've never been treated that way at an aveda salon .
because of her rudeness i left and did not do my hair there .
what a waste of time !
horrible experience @ this ihop .
holy bad service !
forgot order like _num_ times .
i 've been here before but this last time i went sucked .
wo n't make that mistake again .
worst service ever !
this place does not even deserve one star .
poor , slow service .
and the manager just blew off the mistakes .
i would n't bother .
that is not natural .
i have been going to this ihop every month for _num_ years .
our group is anywhere from _num_ to _num_ .
over the past year , service has gone down hill .
`` the kept sitting people at the tables that only could accommodate large groups .
we found a new home and they will get _num_ stars on my review .
the benefit of coming here is that its open _num_ hrs .
nothing else around the area was open at 5:30 am .
and being slow .
when we sat down , we waited another _num_ min for our food .
why would soup take _num_ minutes ?
my daughter made me come but next time i 'll put my foot down .
no more ihop for me .
never going there and telling my friend avoid this location !
the service here , is sooo bad !
they were packed so i could understand a little delay , but come on !
if i could leave less than one star i would .
this place was very unclean .
no more .
poor service and dirty pretty much sums up this experience .
no lemon .
i wish i never came here !
but this place is horrible .
she was not glad to see us first of all .
our waitress came over after a good _num_ to _num_ minute wait .
it took _num_ minutes to get our order out .
waitresses bad talking customers and the manager yelling at them to pick up orders .
i feel the manager had no control .
i was really angry at this time .
the sour dough change must have really been an issue .
i eat my half sandwich , two grapes and two slices of oranges .
i could wait to leave .
not the best tip either .
do n't go here , drive to another ihop .
the worst ever !
we pull up to the parking lot which looks empty .
we go in , there are about _num_ tables of seated customers .
there is _num_ couple waiting to be seated ahead of us .
we wait about _num_ minutes to be seated .
there were only _num_ of us and plenty of _num_ person tables avail .
another 15-20 minutes goes by .
we wait and wait and wait for about _num_ minutes .
i do n't know who 's order we got but it was n't ours .
we attempted to eat some of it but it tasted horrible .
no flavor just plain bland cold rubbery eggs and bacon .
terrible .
went here this morning not really craving breakfast .
he tells me they are out of ranch dressing .
and they proceeds to say `` they '' are doing them bad this week .
my french toast was poorly made and soggy .
i feel like this is a disgrace to all breakfast restaurant .
it did not reach my satisfaction .
she also did not give us the check so we were waiting for hours .
the waitress said `` no '' .
she was not happy .
the waitress did n't even bother to bring me the check !
management needs to either train their staff better or be replaced themselves .
ridiculous !
i 've waited over _num_ min for a single order .
does it really take _num_ minutes to make some french toast ?
management and service is very poor .
ignorant servers .
literally , everybody 's order was messed up .
asked for manager and no manager ever came .
this place is ridiculous .
the chips , carne asada , and carnitas were all sub-par .
the rice was pretty good , however , as was the guacamole .
not so .
we went at lunch and the waiting area was packed !
i still judge a place by it 's beans and these were nasty .
my coworker ordered the chile relleno and chicken enchilada lunch special .
she did n't like her food either .
my husband and i got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas .
the rice and beans were nothing special .
the main dishes arrived and they were a major disappointment !
the tacos were oily and bland .
the beans and rice were not much better .
nothing special or authentic here .
i do n't get it .
you can decide for yourself which to pick .
as for the food ... it 's horribly average .
i do n't want cheddar cheese on my mexican food .
i do n't want jack in the box style tacos .
i do n't need beans and rice on the same plate .
if not , i suggest you skip it .
sadly , i was not impressed .
the salsa was mediocre , and my chimi was soggy and tasteless .
the beans were tasteless as well .
will not be going back .
if i can give it zero star , i would .
there are _num_ of us in the group going there for a birthday lunch .
we complained the salsa was too hot and asked if she has something else .
she said there is nothing less spicy than that .
the food was n't good either .
the beans and the rice were just not good .
greasy tacos , the only thing good was the spicy salsa .
do n't understand what restaurant the other reviewers went to .
i used to frequent this restaurant until what happened to me on april 3rd .
i am totally shocked that people like this restaurant .
the chicken was good but the bagged lettuce was terrible .
the salsa was n't salsa at all just hot sauce .
the guacamole tasted watered down and tasteless .
the cafeteria type setting was also sub-par .
_num_ words ... greasy mess !
that i know of , there were no mistakes and nothing was forgotten .
unfortunately , i do n't know his name !
it 's not free refills fyi !
they start you off with chips and salsa .
mediocre .
nothing worth dying for .
the chicken taco and enchilada were ok.
my tostada was soggy .
the wait for our party was _num_ hour and some minutes .
like , i might throw up everything i ate .
ok i 'm done .
dishonest !
are you kidding me ?
maria told me what the price was and it almost doubled upon pick up .
after a good wait , we find out breakfast ends at 11am .
the place was clean , loud and lacked ambience and charm .
all of which i could live with , had the food been outstanding .
if you know me , you know i can eat .
there was no soul in this food .
my husband 's combo was as generic as they come .
every time i have gone there the service has been horrible .
poor service !
the chips and salsa were just okay .
the chips were a little stale and over salted .
i orders the tacos which i did not know were fried .
they were super greasy and the beef was very dry .
i feel like this was just a fluke experience .
not authentic in the least .
very disappointed in the quality of the food .
not to mention they offer hard tacos .
the wait is n't worth it unless you do n't know mexican food .
really disappointing customer service experience .
the answer was `` there 's nothing i can do about that . ''
not a good answer - not great customer service .
she did n't even say she would see if she could do anything .
by the way i have never written a review like this before .
had this for lunch one day before work - bad move .
the meal i got , though , was a disappointment .
this is where that salsa we discussed earlier comes in .
i ca n't comment on the beans , because i do n't eat them !
not good .
my other co-worker did not fare nearly as well .
wrong .
gross .
disappointing .
i was given a small bag of tortilla chips , and those were passable .
including a large fountain drink , i paid $ _num_ .
stopped by during a brief trip to the area .
took two bites and asked for our money back .
complained to staff and was offered something else which i declined but no refund .
meat tasted very bitter and left bad taste in my mouth .
it was truly horrible tasting .
go taco bell its better .
the chips were noticeably stale , but the salsa was good .
the carne asada tacos were gross .
the meat tasted spoiled , the texture was weird and it was greasy .
i was very hungry but could only stomach two bites .
the beans were runny and tasted bad .
i will not be back here again .
stopped at this place on the way to phx airport .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
their meat was overcooked and flavorless .
even their tortillas were bad !
it should be illegal to sell food this bad !
gross .
i threw it away after _num_ bites .
even the tortilla was n't cooked all the way .
it was horrible and i wo n't ever be back .
if i could give this place no stars , i would .
i ordered _num_ chicken tacos and _num_ steak taco .
never once did i hear my number be called .
it was busy in there so i continued to wait .
after about _num_ min of waiting , i decided to go to the counter .
the lady then informed me that someone else took my food !
are you freaking kidding me ?
i only get half an hour for my lunch so i was furious !
there was no apologies from anyone .
i did n't even want the food by then .
by that point i was already over my _num_ minute lunch break .
i 'm sure it 's like every other taco shop on mcdowell .
the chips were very basic , and the salsa bored me .
are they hard shell or soft shell ?
why did they put lettuce and cheese on them ?
the shells were ok , but the meat was a poor attempt .
the shredded beef was mushy , no flavor .
chicken texture was ok , but no flavor .
mushy as hell , no flavor at all ... .
only chicken , carne asada or fish .
the meat was just okay nothing stands out .
do n't waste your time here .
there are way too many other options close by that are awesome .
sadly , the meat was really bad .
no taste and the pieces were way too big and full of stringy gristle .
chicken `` works '' giant burrito .
lots of beans but not enough chicken .
thus place is going down hill .
on top of that , the chicken did n't taste so good .
all the old employees have left and the prices have been raised .
the chicken is also tasteless and not grilled anymore .
on this visit i choose the grilled chicken and steak tacos .
however , i did not care for the chicken taco .
the chicken was somewhat dry and lacked flavor .
chicken tacos were not very good .
beef taco was ok.
veggie burrito was ok.
gigantic burrito was not very good .
probably wo n't be back again .
so sad !
ive been coming here for _num_ years and used to love this place .
my _num_ star review is now _num_ .
prices have gone up $ _num_ and portions sizes are going down .
they lost a long time loyal customer today .
unfortunately , i find the chicken pieces not too fresh and unbearable to eat .
this is probably one of the better places phoenix has to offer .
it is dry and flavorless .
sauce is flat and lacks flavor .
i ca n't believe this place gets so many good reviews .
we ordered california rolls , and found them small , dry and not flavorful .
much like grocery store packaged sushi .
the edamame was the worst i have ever had .
really , avoid these !
the crab puffs were nice though .
wanted a light lunch , so ordered a veggie rice bowl .
i chose to have the teriyaki chicken bowl as a replacement .
and , i also hate leaving negative reviews .
that being said , i only tried the chicken teriyaki bowl .
the teriyaki sauce was so watered down it turned my rice into soup .
i was very disappointed with the quality of the chicken teriyaki bowl .
this was horrible !
not worth your time at all !
it just is n't good , not even close to good .
does anyone know a good pizza delivery place downtown phoenix ?
avoid the teriyaki chicken !
it 's really , really bad .
well , i did not know they would use arizona sand as the breading .
the chicken was so over cooked and bland that it dried my mouth .
the saving grace for blue fin are the portions and price point .
this is by far the worst record store i 've ever been in .
unless all you have is a tape player .
so i went to a late lunch with the moms this weekend .
and a crap salad . )
i do n't want to listen to that crap ever .
the service is overall bad .
i did n't get the extra buffalo sauce i asked for .
my cup was empty most of the meal .
this place desperately wants to upscale .
they also do n't have facial tattoos .
but of course they were doughy and meh .
wings are skimpy and over-cooked to a tough , stringy texture .
when we arrived , we ordered a beer , and a soda .
i flagged one of the bartenders down .
me : `` excuse me ? ''
i tell him no , because i have left my card in the past .
you do n't treat me like shit and still get a tip .
yes , i am cut off .
i have had maybe three beers , and a shot , in _num_ hours .
horrible bar service ... all draft beers are out on a saturday !
not worth the stop .
the fish was bland .
the menu promised spicy sauce ... again bland .
i gave up on it after the first few bites .
it was n't worth the work and mess .
these sandwiches and two drinks cost us over $ _num_ .
however , the italian nachos were just plain disgusting .
for my meal , i ordered the bourbon steak flat bread wrap .
not just the worst service , but no service at all !
and this only after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation .
i really wanted to like this place .
we ordered a sandwich that was piled high with turkey .
never mind , after _num_ minutes you 'll eat anything .
beer was overpriced at $ _num_ for a glass .
wo n't be back .
such a terrible experience .
the most pathetic looking chicken nacho came out first .
she ate hers i sent mine back .
my new burger came _num_ minutes later and was super greasy .
they screwed up my bill and took forever to fix .
you will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold .
maybe you should get your facts straight before posting a reply .
there was no demanding there .
pass the word do n't go to this establishment .
she acted quickly , within _num_ minutes our food began to arrive .
they have _num_ items on the menu , most of which are fried .
_num_ minutes later , i finally got served .
granted , she was a bitch , but a bitch with a valid point .
are you kidding me ?
served the guests next to us and still did n't greet my group .
cant see it staying open too long .
actually , why do i care ?
the food is n't good enough , and the experience is n't good enough .
are you kidding me ?
the food ai n't that good .
the worst part ?
why do you make people wait outside when you are empty ?
one time i went there and only two tables were occupied .
they told us there would be a _num_ - _num_ minute wait .
i asked why there is a wait as nearly all the tables were open .
so there are n't enough waiters to handle three tables instead of two ?
despite the place being empty the mean lady told us to wait outside .
i said no thanks .
fate is my worst dining experience in arizona so far .
i wish i could say the same about fate .
unfortunately , that was n't so .
not good .
to put it simply , he thought it sucked .
ordered a chicken thing that was marginal .
and a beef ( leather ) thing with noodles .
the steamed rice was a `` _num_ '' for me .
this was no `` flo 's '' or `` changs '' .
the service did n't suck , but close .
i if you are in the neighborhood , you 've got ta stop by .
less flavorful and not as authentic .
the concept of making people wait even when the restaurant is empty is ridiculous .
i want to like fate but i just do n't .
they cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be ?
holy mother of chicken , christmas and rice .
the ambiance is cool but it does n't justify it .
sadly , fate falls apart in its execution .
he is barely a line cook .
wrong .
the food is horrible .
i really enjoy the atmosphere however the food is worse than a microwave dinner .
the food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order !
`` she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there .
boo : it 's eight hundred degrees outside , and you know what ?
boo : no substitutions .
no sauce on the side .
i do not give a rat 's ass .
if i want a side of sauce , who the hell cares ?
i like it very very very thick , which fate 's was .
the tofu was good , though , crispy and not gooey .
sucked out loud , especially after we got our entrees .
the same server never came by twice .
no thank you .
this place is n't all that it 's hyped up to be .
i 've had better from , i 'm embarrassed to admit - pei wei .
i had the beef pad thai which was watery and bland .
it was just awful !
nothing special and the portion sizes leave much to be desired .
not so this last time .
the food was awful .
after having eaten here seven or more times , i wo n't be back .
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked ?
we walk and we walk and nothing .
may be this is some breakfast joint and i 'll get me some grits .
the sauce was soupy .
the noodles were not pad thai noodles .
it was n't bad and had a nice kick to it .
but there 's no way that 's pad thai .
this used to be on my very short list of `` favorite '' restaurants .
i am sad to see this place die out .
i really want to like this place .
unfortunately the service is terrible .
the food so , not so great .
they also have steaks and chicken dishes , but why bother ?
i am mexican ... and i know mexican food .
food here is greasy and old .
you ca n't get a bartender like her anywhere !
just wish the food was better !
can one give less that _num_ star ?
that fuzzy stuff is probably 10+ years of dust .
promptly served _num_ glasses of ice water and a menu .
chose bacon & eggs for $ _num_ .
overall , just o.k .
if they did the average rating would n't be _num_ stars .
so i really can not comment on how great it was .
but like sing high , the downtown nostalgia restaurants are extremely scary .
just avoid this ... it 's not good .
the salsa was tasty , but i would hardly add a star to it .
i could n't blame my add on it .
there was more staff standing around than patrons .
the seafood inside of the burrito was not really seafood at all .
the only saving grace on this boring tasteless plate was the refried beans .
soft and cheesy , the beans saved the day .
the bill was less than $ _num_ bucks .
they had some chips and salsa in the bar , but neither was good .
seriously the food is really bad .
how can a mexican restaurant get mexican food so wrong ?
should my beans be orange ?
i was served promptly and and my food came out quickly .
service was slow .
they did n't even offer sangria .
it 's hard to do mexican this bad , but they pulled it off .
i am from chicago where authentic mexican restaurants are abundant .
the rice & beans that came with were no better .
terrible service .
sat inside for ten minutes with no service .
moved outside and sat _num_ minutes with no service .
waiter was aware he had customers , just did n't care !
service was not good , they forgot about us after our dinner was served .
chips tasted stale .
no bueno on the green corn tamales and the service was terrible for lunch .
none of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned .
it 's really not that hard .
when i did eat there , the food really was n't that great .
usually a bite or two is good , then it just gets really gross .
the potato salad was the only thing that i actually thought was okay .
several _num_ or _num_ people groups at _num_ people tables .
strike one - wait staff should shepherd small groups to small tables .
our waitress finds us after a _num_ minute wait and takes our beer order .
another review said that the waitress had been on for _num_ hours .
i 'm not sure what everybody raves about .
i took it to go , which may have been my first problem .
ick !
ick # _num_ !
when all is said and done , yes , i 'm full .
the chicken was ok , a little dry , but edible .
the giant horse scared me !
i thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance .
it was disgusting .
i 'm just not a fan of cold sausage .
i had a pita sandwich and it was just under $ _num_ .
walking in we were greeted by terrible music .
_num_ min later he says they are out of that to .
the server must have been embarrassed i would have been .
about _num_ minutes after we ordered we received our food .
the menu looks like it was written by a kid in the first grade .
also , it was written on one piece of white paper .
there were no descriptions of any of the food .
a bit slow .
they did n't know what was in the items .
the food was not good .
it was terrible .
the chicken was boiled and had no seasoning .
it was the worst shawarma i have ever had .
however , the potato salad was tasty .
for the price of the food , everything should have tasted better .
unless you go during happy hour , the prices do n't seem worth it .
ugh .
he was terrible .
and it was so loud we could barely hear each other .
sadly , it just wore us out .
one of the bowls they brought us was dirty too .
this is the worst chinese restaurant i have ever been to .
too expensive for a hole in the wall .
i ordered two entrees , fried rice , egg rolls and two beverages .
i did n't even have a single bite .
it was $ _num_ .
that killed my appetite .
also the place looked like a dump .
the ceiling looked like it had water damage .
the whole place was trashy looking .
i would give this _num_ stars if it were just her .
but her office staff gets _num_ stars .
bottom line do n't pee in the cup .
at & t is the worst wireless service i 've ever had .
this may be a record ; they lasted less than _num_ hrs for me !
giant mistake .
so i called customer service back , and they were closed .
i 'm going back to verizon and im never leaving again !
the phoenix light rail is a huge disappointment .
for me , paradise bakery is a poor man 's panera .
paradise bakery is disappointing in a few ways .
second , the caesar salad is horrible .
also the croutons are not very tasty either .
third , they completely use too much dressing on their salads .
bad food , worse service .
the waitress was hot , though .
it really should be _num_ stars .
the worst part is i can never eat another tamale again , ever .
but it was like pulling teeth to get more .
the chips and salsa are great , but everything else is pretty bland .
i am a fan of tamales and i would definitely not order it again .
the chicken was so dry and chewy .
i really do n't have much to say about this place .
i did n't hate it , but did n't love it .
and for the tortillas , there was none in the soup .
eh ... .
i was disgusted .
nothing too fancy or exciting .
went to the movie early saturday evening , but ate beforehand .
i know i would have gotten tastier food for the money .
i told the waitress and she said , `` oh , ok '' .
why did n't i check yelp first ?
i got this chicken parmesan type dish , only made mexican style .
anyways , i think the ideas here are good , just need better execution .
food was ok , but nothing i would go back for .
so this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom .
almost could n't even sit down to go .
( yuck ) ok on to the rest .
the chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice .
the only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa .
it was so bland .
i was starving and could n't even finish it .
i 've definitely had better drinks and i 've definitely had worse .
the tortilla soup was really bad .
it tasted like a mix of chili powder and salt .
the chicken fajitas were actually ok , but not great .
overall , there are much better choices .
horrible and fake !
this is by far the worst mexican food that i have ever experienced .
salsa , canned , fake and simply unacceptable .
this is the point where i should have ran for the exit .
the rice , meh , but edible .
the asada or `` steak '' at this mexican restaurant , a saucy mess .
i 'll spare you all the rest of this mess of a meal .
one of the most disgusting restaurants i 've ever eaten at .
the place was bad news from the very beginning .
you could n't pay me to go back to this restaurant .
somewhat slow service and the food was only so-so .
so fake .
waitress did n't even ask how my food was .
because she knew it sucked .
for lunch _num_ taco with rice and beans $ _num_ .
regular menu _num_ tacos , rice and beans $ _num_ ?
nasty margarita and awful service .
came in on a thursday night before a movie and it was not good .
i 'm not sure , but no one wanted to help us .
the house margarita was so gross , could n't drink it .
i had the tortilla soup and the grilled chicken tacos .
not truly flavorful , nothing truly distinct .
probably not .
i walked _num_ feet to this place .
the worst disappointment was my main course - i ordered the red beef tamales .
these are the worst tamales that i remember eating .
and i am an awful cook !
she was prompt at with refilling our ice tea , but not hovering .
a mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy !
rice is too bland and the beans are ok .
but it 's not there yet .
i ordered the chicken deep fried tacos .
i really was n't impressed .
no flavor .
the tortilla was n't crispy enough .
not a good meat to veggie to tortilla ratio .
the food was not good .
once again , it was a chewy , mediocre seasoned piece of meat .
i 'm not a fan of mexican restaurants that have crappy salsa and chips .
sorry , it 's just a standard by which i live by .
the salsa was _num_ % water which is a bummer .
then we had a hard time finding our waiter .
the first time , i had a horribly rude waitress and slow service .
the food was mediocre .
the staff is ehh and not that friendly or fast .
felt that this was very generic .
i wo n't be going back .
the chips were very watery .
the server was courteous which is always a must for me .
as i 'm writing i 'm tasting the guacamole .
very bland !
the shrimp tacos are mediocre at best .
do n't eat here when it 's busy .
however , the service was really slow and poor overall .
do n't know how they kept it from falling through the grill .
today it was horrible .
this was the worst mexican restaurant i have ever .
the grilled shrimp that my wife ordered were tasteless and not grilled .
she threw up later that night .
who can mess up a burrito .
even taco bell can do a better job .
and the worst service ever .
do n't waste your time .
will not be going again .
do not do business with this company .
i would give the cabinets _num_ stars .
cons : poor customer service .
called after _num_ weeks , no call back ; called again .
waited another _num_ weeks without a call .
no calls .
i told them how disappointed i was in the lack of customer service .
... i was pissed !
what is it with everything closing sooo damn early in phoenix !
( ... i am from la ) .
avoid at all costs .
when you order something , you should n't get another .
i hate chicken and i got it anyway .
i did n't know until i got back to my conference .
anyway , it was n't even that good .
and it made me sick .
i do n't totally blame baja though .
baja unfortunately just fell out of my butt hours later .
fatty meat low quality with inflated prices .
... just go there instead .
their supposedly best hot wings are n't even close to being the best .
i 'm pissed .
also , why does it have to be _num_ degrees ?
i had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it .
your tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced .
stay away from this hooters .
bad food , bad service .
not hot at all ) .
the wings are tiny and completely overcooked .
i do not recommend these at all .
friend # _num_ ordered the boneless wings , which are a joke .
however , friend # _num_ received the same thing this time .
i do not recommend these at all .
friend # _num_ ordered a dozen hot wings .
i do not recommend these at all .
overall , the worst restaurant in phoenix , i think .
oh , ps , they have never brought out our correct bill .
overpriced food with shady looking waitresses .
i thought i would try out this location , big mistake .
first parking is a nightmare .
i felt completely ignored for _num_ minutes , will never come back .
not the best hooters but definitely not the worst .
i love hooters wings , i wo n't be back to this hooters .
brittany , you are a terrible waitress .
my buddy goes , `` umm , can we get some service ?
i asked for ranch and never got it .
brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend 's drink .
she did n't take our order so of course she did n't know .
no one asked us this .
btw , those big tables were long gone by then .
it was actually pretty empty by then .
this is the very worst service that i have ever had .
my wings were n't even that great .
we were ok with that but it was not busy at all .
i left this location with a bad experience and hungry .
gross .
stopped here for a late night snack .
shortly , i was brought over _num_ sliders that were the size of meatballs .
yes , they brought me _num_ pieces of overcooked meat on buns .
my sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible .
if it was n't for that , they would n't have gotten any .
umm ... it was clean .
wish i could select zero stars !
possibly the worse service ever .
i did n't even get to eat them at the restaurant .
worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything .
possibly the worse service ever .
should of been a zero star rating .
they have tables but really low seats and some tables with high stools .
never going to any hooters again .
_num_ ) flat ass everywhere .
i had it elsewhere in multiple states from hooters .
the food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried .
the lady stated that it was breaded and grilled .
did n't like the service or lack there of or the food .
not a service friendly place .
the absolute worst service i 've ever had in my life !
1st and only time i 've ever let a hooters place hungry .
i 'm extremely disappointed .
i 'm seriously feeling like i 've been cheated .
this was really disappointing .
this was n't okay .
a few of us local regular co-workers tried to eat at hooters for lunch .
bad management !
no one at front desk to sit us .
finally try to get a waitress .
they have crappy wings anyway .
if i could give it a negative _num_ i would .
we were starving and thirsty for a cold drink .
four confused people look over to a pretty empty bar area .
nothing was special .
would have been _num_ stars if not for our hostess experience .
walked in to have some quick appetizers before a movie .
we sat down no waitress came to ask for our drinks or introduce herself .
horrible customer service !
but she must have confused us for someone else .
have n't been back since , and never will go .
there has n't been a time where i have had a bad experience here .
cold , dull fries that had an old taste to them .
super soggy and just absolutely terrible .
it was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce .
no flavor , and not the amazing wings i usually get there .
i read the negative reviews thinking this is not true .
honestly , i am extremely disappointed .
the negative reviews did n't lie .
all i have to say was food was very crappy !
wings are super hard and have no meat .
bad service , worse food .
i would not recommend this place .
do not get fish and chips , over fried on old oil .
i went to hooters after a meeting with some friends .
the chicken was awful on the salad .
i put my salad in the trash .
a short walk from the convention center .
they were n't too busy , so we were quickly seated outside .
food was pretty bad .
the chicken itself was mcdonald 's quality .
i know one typically does n't go to hooters for the food .
this place sucks .
there are so many empty tables .
the staff is really overwhelmed for no reason .
hostess said they are understaffed , not really my problem .
poor management is hooters problem and they need to fix it .
worst hooters i have ever been to and not consistent with the brand .
service was very slow , but the food though was good .
showed up with _num_ girlfriends for the last ufc fights .
walked in and sat at the table our friend was waiting .
will never go back to this hooters .
will not return anytime soon , was hoping to have a good day .
the manager juan was and idiot and said he was not seating anybody .
the waitress said any other manager would not do this .
need i say more juan was rude and seated people behind us .
why would anyone pay money for food like this ?
overcooked pasta , check .
look people , al dente and toss the alfredo on the noodle .
not my deal , though .
avoid at all costs .
i was amazed how much the food sucked at this place.
apparently the kitchen manager was on vacation and no one placed the supply order .
so not cool .
i remember when going to the spaghetti company was something to look forward to .
the salad was mostly dismal .
there are times when i wish i could go back .
unfortunately phoenix is slowly but surely returning to its roots .
surely it is not at the old spaghetti factory .
both times service has been horrible .
beyond the lousy service , the food is not good .
i really do n't like tomatoes in caesar salad .
second , our waiter brought it out with the other salads .
lastly the wine selection is pathetic .
for generic italian food , go to the olive garden .
i 'm not sure exactly what happened , but the food went way downhill !
the chicken parm that i got was pathetic to say the least .
once she showed up , it was n't completely horrible .
i used to have really fond memories of this place as a kid .
other than service , the food is doing little to impress me .
this gave me time to look around again for the first time .
ok so this is not fine dining i know that , i accept this .
what in gods name does that mean i have no idea ?
nor do i know why a cheese lover would love this dish .
clam chowder was the soup and salty was its name .
bruce looked over and said ; man that looks dry is it missing something ?
i am not sure what the fuss is about this place .
this added garlic , mushrooms and bacon .
the portions were smaller than i remembered .
rather than send it back i kept the salad .
i like to be checked on occasionally , but too much is annoying .
i did n't know my spaghetti came with sausage .
overall - $ _num_ for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience .
probably the worst italian food i 've ever had !
how do you mess up italian food that bad ?
i 'll begin with the food .
the salad was _num_ and then entree was full price .
i did n't press the issue , paid the bill and off we go .
they were not busy at all for a saturday night .
the staff were friendly enough , but a little too casual .
the restaurant has lost its class .
it was very bland and way over priced for the portions served .
it was my 2nd time there and it was n't anything like i remembered .
all i ordered was the soup and salad lunch special .
just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals .
quality and service is terrible here .
there is way many better italian food restaurants in the valley .
this is a pretty lame review actually .
not sure .
fine , two reasons to hate it .
a joke of a salad .
the lasagna was loaded with meat and just enough ricotta to balance .
the color on everything that we were served was off and pale .
my pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce .
while the prices are good it 's not worth a less than average meal .
husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala .
chances of going back are slim to none .
our server was prompt and our drinks came quickly .
i had spaghetti with meat sauce and my wife and son had chicken parmesan .
we all felt the spaghetti was tasteless and the chicken was rubbery .
all in all a very disappointing meal .
the prices here a similar to most italian chain restaurants .
sorry but i actually have one of these restaurants in my town .
originally i wanted to give them _num_ stars but the food quality was bad .
i could n't justify an average rating for way below average italian .
my entree was really disappointing .
horrible service .
not as good as an olive garden .
again , horrible service !
i do not recommend .
disgusting !
the food was worse than fast food .
pasta was overcooked .
broccoli tasted old , like really old .
a place like this does n't deserve to take your money .
there was absolutely no effort put in the food or service .
having been there before , my friend knew she wanted the lasagna .
all entrees come with bread , soup or salad , and tea or coffee .
our waiter delivered the soup and salad , but forgot the dressing .
sadly , even their bread was n't all that flavorful .
`` , then i remembered he does n't work with chains .
i have been twice and both times both of our entrees were cold .
it was possibly the worst pasta dish i have ever had .
the chicken was so dry i could not eat it .
it tasted like it was either boiled , reheated or a little of both .
well it was _num_ dollar ... .
what a rip off .
first i ordered a diet coke that was watered down .
cheap .
flavorless and not worth the cost .
mine came back a mess .
the spaghetti was hard , not smooth tasting like they should be .
the marinara sauce on everything we ordered was bland .
the italian sausage i was afraid to even bite into .
when i did , it was cold and spit it right out .
either way no excuse to serve what they served .
i would have preferred burger king food over this place .
she was very overwhelmed with _num_ tables and i am unsure why .
my family of _num_ went for dinner on a saturday night .
the hostess staff was rude and had to get the manager involved .
food did not come out hot at all .
the food was also average nothing special about it .
i would not recommend this place and will not be coming back .
under _num_ is the max .
if this place were any faster , they would have drive through .
the guest are broke , or old .
they 're here for a cheap feeding .
your not gon na get 4-5 star food for what your paying for .
and - you should tip according to how much you ate .
horrible experience !
service was ok , nothing special .
the bread tasted weird and the actual food was just nasty .
crap from a can .
the drinks tasted like sewer water and the manager didnt care one bit .
the walls and ceiling were moldy and the service sucked .
the restaurant is less than half full ... we are quickly seated .
but not an appetizing smell .
it took _num_ minutes for our server to even greet the group .
several minutes later our server arrives with our salads , soups and drinks .
one of the worst dining experiences i 've ever had .
we ordered the lasagna with marinara sauce and manicotti with meat sauce .
the noodles were cooked perfectly and that 's where the praise stops .
it was only me and i felt like they did n't care .
the salad was soggy too .
needless to say i was invited for a group dinner and graciously obliged .
ugh .
people were standing by our entrance waiting for their table , poor design .
the waiter was n't very friendly , his service was very poor .
he would disappear for 10-15 between each action .
_num_ minutes till drink delivery .
drinks are delivered he disappeared again for another 10-15 minutes .
the food is mediocre at best , i can make it at home .
i got the chicken parmigiana with fettuccine alfredo .
the portion of food in comparison to the price , is small .
the food portions need to be increased by _num_ % .
took about _num_ minutes to get our drinks because our waiter was also bartender .
garlic bread and complementary bread were pretty good .
very hard to eat more than a couple bites .
chicken in my pasta was definitely frozen and looked like rubber .
i 'm glad i tried it but i wo n't come back .
do n't go here expecting a nice quiet lunch or dinner .
_num_ min wait on a tuesday with empty restaurant .
`` unfortunately we 're low on servers . ''
what this place lacks in quality , should be made up for in ease .
he came back and stated that they told him another _num_ minutes .
with that i thanked him for his time grabbed my family and walked out .
i met several friends for a birthday here , saturday night .
my check for _num_ was about $ _num_ including the added gratuity .
i probably wo n't go back to find out .
our server , michael was awesome .
no apology , no `` drinks are on us '' nothing .
totally lost my appetite !
uh really there is literally not one other patron in the place .
still no water .
still no water .
we then walked out and will not ever go there again .
went here to meet a friend for lunch .
did not like the food at all .
their pasta was very dry ( yes even with the sauce ) .
flavor was very disappointing .
so , i was sorely disappointed with the phoenix branch .
the food horrible i should have made my own .
food just was not that good .
my guy got the meatballs and spaghetti both dishes where nasty as hell .
this was our first and last experience at the old spaghetti factory .
our food was as miserable as the service .
it was the perfect unappetizing , terrible end to a generally terrible experience .
just gross .
not one person , not one , stopped to say anything !
_num_ thumbs down !
all in all very disappointed and we will not be back .
the only thing worse than the service is the food .
pure garbage .
wrong !
too bad , they missed the last time i 'll ever eat there .
my waitress was extremely rude and did n't know anything about the menu .
i could n't even get my water refilled .
he takes my card says sorry and charges me for everything .
do n't waste your time or you money going here .
the only good thing was the decor .
we made a reservation at 7pm ; did n't get helped until 8pm .
the hostess was terrible at her job .
now it just tastes so commercial not at all like it used too .
i 'm going to miss it the way it was .
why must you continually want to patronize boring chain restaurants .
lousy customer service .
if they say a _num_ minute wait .
talked to the hostess and they do n't care .
that makes no sense and is a very poor pricing model .
sad and pitiful really .
this was probably the single worst place we 've eaten .
do n't waste your time or money .
just left here , will not be back .
artichoke dip was all oil , no cheese .
when your meal for _num_ is _num_ dollars , i expect some etiquette .
no toilet paper .
the food was flavorless tasted liked the generic lasagna that you buy at walmart .
not good .
i went on a wednesday , during lunch , when school was in session .
they also had no coleslaw which is served on many sandwiches .
i paid $ _num_ for a bad sandwich and a drink .
i will not be going back .
my sandwich was n't terrible , just ok .
definately not worth $ _num_ !
i 've been there for breakfast and lunch and it 's ok .
i could n't eat it , it was not flavorful just a burning heat .
sandwiches are ok , nothing to really jump and down about .
terrible sandwich .
stale bread , dry sandwich , no flavor .
cashier was grumpy with a bad attitude .
food was once again , not terrible , but not what i ordered .
he got angry and slammed away when i asked him who he was .
i want tom 's to be better ... but it is n't .
wrong !
the worst part ?
they put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast !
i went , that 's it , i 'm done .
the chicken was quite dry , it came with wild rice ( wtf ? )
f ?
that screams out `` filler '' .
there was pico de gallo which was n't too bad .
despite my beer being empty .
tonight was the last time .
and we did , it was tom 's restaurant and tavern .
it was a special event menu , which i really hate .
there were about _num_ vegetarian options , few of which seemed appetizing .
i was also really disappointed by the menu .
the food is great but the side salad was a disappointment .
finally the food came out and it was mediocre at best .
it tasted like cardboard and the roll it was on was hard .
it was served dry with tomato and lettuce if you wanted it .
however , the food and service are lacking .
i wish this place were better !
however , both were terrible .
my friends burger was also lackluster and flavorless .
for the price i would expect better food ... much better food .
honestly , they should get rid of the tables and add more beer taps .
quit the food , up the drinks .
the french dip was the worst of the _num_ .
the cuban pork was mediocre at best .
the blt - only okay at best .
the staff was very attentive , hostess was cheerful and welcomed us warmly .
$ _num_ for _num_ lunches and one soda - not worth it .
just like the rest of downtown phoenix , this place was dead .
the food was okay , but nothing to write to my yelp friends about .
and just a handful of stale chips .
# _num_ who puts jalapeno in spinach artichoke dip ?
it was so gross ... we sent it back .
then the worst ... the cheeseburger .
it was over cooked to the point of a leather consistency .
also , it was so bland .
she sucked .
needless to say we wo n't be visiting ever again .
keep in mind this is a bbq joint - with no bbq .
the service was horrible .
wilted to the point where i did n't want to touch it .
service was horrible .
we arrived shortly after opening on january _num_ , _num_ .
my wife is not a picky eater so this was to take note of .
what are the chances both our lunches were a fluke .
needless to say we were sorely disappointed after dropping $ _num_ .
this was the worst run bar i have ever been in my life .
bartenders did n't know what they were doing and were inefficient as hell .
it was super bowl weekend and they were understaffed so i get it .
but the whole situation was handled poorly .
really sets a bad example for phx events .
disappointed and wo n't be back .
i was sooo excited to find your place .
wtf kind of crap is that ?
i was not impressed with my meal .
i ca n't speak of the cobbler though .
the burger was dry and did n't have a great taste .
i received a only a handful of fries and my soda was mostly ice .
i went to get my refill and was charged $ _num_ !
maybe i 'll just skip the food and go to the cobbler next time .
the hours of operation seem just random for one .
how about not having sport peppers and serving it a stale crappy bun ?
i 'm just saying , it was a bit insulting .
they turned out to be a huge disappointment and we will not return .
stupid is as stupid does i guess .
so ... ... get your car washed at your own risk .
terrible car wash !
avoid at all cost !
worst car wash ever .
i get the same bs everytime i go .
i 'm not happy , and i 'm not going back either .
not sure i 'll be going back .
went to los olivos for the first time today to get my car washed .
-i paid for the complete works , but the vacuuming job was really shoddy .
i am going to have to vacuum it again myself later .
my very first review - my dark blue car ruined on the exterior .
rick was the gentleman from los olivos who accompanied me .
not acceptable .
this place has really gone down over the years .
i 'm only giving one star because i have too .
first time i purchased the $ _num_ basic wash .
however , when i got my car back i was not impressed at all .
my jeep was beyond dirty on the outside .
not so much on the inside but it could use a clean .
i was very disappointed in the work they did .
my seats were not vacuumed .
half of dash is wiped down the other half is not .
they gave me vanilla .
just little details that add to the horrible work they do .
i could have saved myself some money and time if i did do that .
i will never go to this place again .
do not go here .
first off , i asked them for a exterior detail .
i 'm not sure why i even tried giving this business another shot .
what a waste of time .
what the hell kind of business are you running ?
this is n't breaking bad , stop trying to do shady work .
do not , i repeat , do not visit this establishment .
this is ridiculous !
slow .
... slow .
so slow .
_num_ min and counting , i wo n't be returning i value my time .
not a day later and it was all over the side of the truck .
i will never go here nor would i refer anyone to go here .
literally slowest car wash ever both times i 've been here .
do not , i repeat , do not visit this establishment .
ridiculous wait times !
unfortunately i will not be back .
if i could do negative stars i would .
this is a place you should not go if you want a clean car .
what the hell kind of business are you running ?
thanks for taking my money and not cleaning my car .
they locked my keys in my car and left me to figure it out .
they were also hostile and blamed me for it .
they were so rude .
this is where i started kicking myself for not washing my own car .
my car ended up behind _num_ other cars .
no big deal i thought .
wrong .
a waste of _num_ dollars .
not even close .
my car sat outside and dried for _num_ minutes .
took them almost an hour to wash my car .
i was not told that .
she then told me there was a sign saying that .
there was n't .
yes , seriously - _num_ minutes !
the car wash itself is ok .
since the wait time is significant , i wish there were better seating options .
the second time i complained enough that they ran the car through again .
this used to be my favorite place .
i am so done ... the quality of work is horrible .
do you have an hour to wait for a $ _num_ car wash ?
the slowest , mediocre car wash in phoenix .
this is a $ _num_ car wash , at best .
slowest car wash ever .
this place definitely lacks good customer service and organization .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
first off i have been coming here for a couple years .
my problem now ?
it did n't seem to be a problem the past couple years .
not me .
they will never see a dime from me ever .
they better miss me with that bullshit .
plus the ticket lady was very unprofessional .
but the outside had tons of water spots and was n't done very well .
why are they such jerks ?
total attitude from the time i walked in to paying the bill .
bread was cold and stale .
pastrami was nothing special .
do n't bother .
quality was okay and food is kind of bland .
just finished my first trip to the downtown deli .
for a lunch total of _num_ dollars for a sandwich fries and a drink .
so , so sad !
so no comment on the structure or service .
it is not horrible , but also not quite good either .
very uninspired in all foods i have tasted .
my only down note is on the service .
i seriously do n't know how this place rates a three star average .
just like many other reviewers , i really wanted to like this place .
this place is just ok in my book .
i went back and tried it again .
my fruit cup was sour , my sandwich was stale and just blah tasting .
we stopped in for lunch last week .
and my husband selected the greek chicken marinara .
thanks , but no thanks .
i 'm just glad we did n't pay $ _num_ for each slice !
it is a void .
the sandwiches were dry and not very good .
the food is just bad .
my chicken sandwich was dry .
i do n't know how this place stays in business .
the menu is so limited .
would you like chicken or chicken ?
chicken in a pita ?
chicken on some lettuce ?
chicken rolled in a tortilla ?
and the pita chips are bland !
and the potato salad has something in it that is way too tangy .
do n't get me wrong , i like feta ... but on everything ?
pretty colors and shiny things however do n't impress my palate .
instead , their food is bland .
the coupon gave me pretty much any menu item with a drink purchase .
i could have made it better for $ _num_ at home .
i really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland .
i had the greek pita and there was nothing greek about it .
but ... i will visit _num_ more times for a total of _num_ .
_num_ strikes and you 're out is fair , right ?
and if you scratch the dressing , it 'll be healthy .
oh , and they did n't burn my sandwich alright .
it looked like it would be great !
flavors were good , nothing special .
( still i 'm strangely addicted to it ) .
you can go to paradise or subway for a whole lot less .
also , the restaurant is just dirty .
so gross !
my intention is not to get free stuff .
that being said , here is my update .
then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate .
unnecessary , i tell him , but nice touch .
now , _num_ weeks later , nothing .
i was pretty excited to try this place .
i was disappointed .
my cole slaw was super soggy and loaded with mayo .
i asked for no mustard on my club pita and it had mustard .
the pita was hard around the edges .
it could have been just a rare bad day .
not bad , but not the best .
i 'm glad i took the workers suggestions because the pasta salad was amazing !
which is too bad because i love that they support local so much .
i ordered the steak kabobs with roasted vegetables and potatoes .
the vegetables were old , and the potatoes were soggy and flavorless .
the chicken tasted great , the greek salad it was served on was flavorful .
i am being kind with the _num_ star rating .
almost $ _num_ for a few cut up pieces of sub par fruit .
too much money for what was a terrible terrible terrible meal .
floor was a mess as were tables .
no real plates or silverware ... it was really kind of lame .
the branch was empty with the exception of a few employees .
horrible customer response .
i asked for a milkshake , not once but twice .
i got _num_ cups of ice cream .
slow service out of food when ordering had to pick other foods for lunch .
i would not recommend it to anyone .
i would n't recommend this place .
the met apartments are not energy efficient !
the fact is , these apartments are _num_ years old and need upgrades terribly !
this is the most understaffed subway in phx .
the problem with that is that i am usually trying to catch a movie .
it was not very busy .
worst subway in the history of the world .
their sandwiches really are n't all that healthy .
i did n't feel the holy spirit there at all .
good reasons to never listen to this terrible station again .
i wouldnt call this a salsa club .
it looked ok , i liked the outside patio ?
but i left outta there wanting to go to a real latin club .
i more than likely will not go back .
now maybe 3-4 .
if that station is not playing great music try _num_ .
now i can not stand to listen to it .
it 's sad how few options actually presented themselves .
so , we were led back to hard rock cafe .
we did n't feel like parking again .
but service unfortunately has been a regular issue .
the problem came when she had to leave to move her car .
that 's _num_ extra minutes with a toddler who was getting tired .
but unfortunately - i ca n't .
the food is average and the drinks are n't anything out of the ordinary .
a hard rock scottsdale would be way cooler .
we had overpriced salads and hamburgers that were large and filling and tasted decent .
while the service is usually ok , the food has always been mediocre .
today was the worst , though .
i did n't mind my overpriced drink that visit .
i do n't really know why .
the phoenix one is one of the worst i 've been to .
never great , never bad .
the shop is way too small and the merchandise is pretty lame .
turned around , went back in , and told the hostess .
buy a beer , walk around and see some dead guys ' guitars .
in fact , we should already be closed . ''
as a bartender , i 'd have insisted that it be so .
and there were about _num_ other people in there at the bar , too .
maybe it 's the corporate management bs that was in the way .
either way , they need to get it together on the hospitality tip .
last night 's dinner was no different .
as it turns out , service was what it usually is , slow .
meanwhile glasses sat empty on the table .
nothing special .
most of us had burgers and they were all just basic burgers .
i had the california burger and it was a big sloppy mess .
the fries were bland .
i went to the phoenix hard rock cafe for lunch on a friday .
and nothing i had was good .
for $ _num_ i got the worst plate of nachos i have ever had !
did not come completely mixed and barely pink .
i had a few bites of the sundae and it was even awful !
the entry is nothing eye catching or grand as it was then .
lame !
it is small and boring inside .
save your money and find somewhere else to dine .
seriously not worth the _num_ min wait and messy restroom either !
_num_ people walk in on a friday night .
seriously , i think she thought she was done for the night .
this hard rock is really nothing special .
overpriced and mediocre food at best .
who does n't want a hard rock cafe phoenix shirt ?
limited beer selection .
mediocre food .
not worth the wait .
it just felt kind of depressing .
ca n't remember the last time i was at a hard rock cafe .
he clearly could n't care less .
- the burger was dry , like it was previously frozen .
- the veggies on the side to put on the burger were n't crisp .
i usually like lettuce on my burger , but not their wilted lettuce .
- the music videos they play are awful .
while i 'm not a music expert , my guest is .
the mac n ' cheese was nothing special .
the service was beyond poor .
the food sucks .
when we got there , the table had not even been set up .
$ _num_ burgers that do n't look interesting ?
meat was a step above over cooked .
my fries tasted like it was fried in really old oil .
the manager was not willing to listen either .
a very bad experience .
terrible service on a saturday night !
oh and the food was bad all around .
_num_ stars for just the food .
i asked for a root beer and a burger with no onions .
for _num_ minutes .
horribly cooked burger .
bad layout of the main floor .
go to arrogant butcher .
the drinks were decent ... but nothing to make me stay there .
i will not ever step foot in the establishment again .
this is the absolute worst service that i have ever experienced .
at this rate , i 'm surprised they even have customers .
when she brought out our to go boxes , she did n't bring enough .
get your act together , hard rock !
we return to see the food taken away .
they cooked us a less then worthy steak to replace it .
i was completed disappointed .
our server was mediocre .
so weird they would n't allow .
a little annoying considered the $ _num_ price .
i got sick from the ribs ... no one was happy with their meal .
we all received _num_ cookies .
if it were possible i would have given this place a _num_ star rating .
everything from the service to the food was terrible .
worst experience ever .
slow .
bar tender is on speed and sucks .
everything else was a poor experience .
party of _num_ , one of their entrees was forgotten .
also , this place is way too small .
very crowded , making for an uncomfortable experience .
this place is ridiculous !
i have family visiting from out of town .
we did n't argue just ordered our food and quickly left .
she was rude , curt and generally unfriendly .
will not be returning .
and the manager was so rude to everyone .
the staff is rude and all standing around talking .
we got there at _num_ and was told an hour wait which was fine .
the only thing i could think is they were hoping shift changes ?
we got there at _num_ and was told an hour wait which was fine .
the only thing i could think is they were hoping shift changes ?
if you just need to fill your gut with something ... why not ?
i have tried the pizza several times and find it rather bland .
this is the short bus of all mcdonald 's .
four , and this is the worst .
are you freaking kidding me ?
this is fast food not your local coffee shop .
oh , wait .
unfortunately , out of _num_ visits they have only had the bagged ice once .
then i get someone who is rude and say 's yes .
the hash browns are gross .
it was a terrible experience in every possible way .
got ta remember not to return here ever !
bad service .
also i spotted a few homeless guys just outside sitting .
not only that , the place is n't all that neat .
however the bright spot is this smoking hot young mexican woman named kim .
do n't even bother coming here .
but unfortunately that did not happen .
why the hell are they getting paid $ _num_ an hour ?
total waste of time .
worst mcdonald 's i 've ever been to .
i 've tried multiple times and they just never have it .
they also quite frequently mess up our orders .
staff does n't seem to care .
rude !
i wish it were better because i live around the corner .
sonic down the street from now on .
just does n't scream exciting to me .
phoenix downtown is boring overall .
very nice facility , easy to get around .
i have never experienced a weeks worth of useless personnel .
( do n't eat at tortillas . )
although they advertise take out , there is no take out menu .
the atmosphere is stale and the service adequate .
my stomach was upset by the small amount i sampled .
i will not visit jordan 's again .
stay away from this place period , especially if you 're a veteran .
note : i will update my review if i need to go back .
eight business days later , i call back like wtf ?
so i said i need another doctor then .
my father was just to weak and sick to leave the home .
we ordered the full sized breakfast burritos with cheddar and black forest bacon .
$ _num_ for the burritos and _num_ bottled waters .
friendly service and clean but boring , bland ambiance .
nothing like the location at town and country .
try the breakfast club across the street .
been trying for _num_ mins on and off to order a delivery .
i get voice mail and nothing else .
i know prices go up , but that is ridiculous .
during a busy lunch rush you would imagine that sandwiches could be made quickly .
waiting 15-20 minutes is ridiculous .
plus $ _num_ for a half sandwich ?
very disappointed and will not be back .
no thanks .
disgusting .
i paid almost $ _num_ for my steak sandwich .
it did n't take that long to cook .
when i got my sandwich , it was a skinny little thing .
nothing compares to it !
but if your craving one , do n't come here .
business hours posted said they closed at 4pm on saturday 's .
the whole thing is incredibly bland and flavorless .
i 've been there _num_ times and it has n't failed yet .
i got the chicken tenders and they were awful .
they tasted like the chicken patties you get in a school lunch .
the french fries were soggy .
looked dead so did n't even try .
the arizona center is to phoenix as the galleria is to scottsdale .
there a a few restaurants still open , but barely .
never seen any of them even close to half full .
the lady at the phoenix visitors center highly suggested we check this place out .
needed a quick bite across the street after i landed at the sheraton .
in short , some interesting stores and restaurants all just thrown together .
this place was sooo empty !
the restaurants here are mediocre and somewhat boring .
everything else is sit down with waiter service .
too quote a famous movie `` iceberg ahead !
lame !
it 's pretty dead , with lots of empty shops .
lame !
wo n't be wasting our time here again .
no more , no more !
this is just sad .
absolutely wasted potential .
i blame the ridiculous payment required parking structure .
that 's a shame .
rude .
terrible , terrible service .
sloppy work - uneven filing , polish uneven .
impersonal and rude service .
will not go back .
the manager makes my nail technician leave me and do linda williams job .
i had to wait _num_ minutes until i got attention again .
because of the delay , i did not get good treatment .
the manager did n't even offer to comp my service .
i was so disappointed in this nail salon .
but it was not .
the lady doing my manicure was nice , at least she smiled .
do n't talk to me like i 'm twelve .
i am not one to write bad reviews .
then the finished product was crappy .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
this is the first time yelp reviews have let me down .
three days later the shellac cracked and began to peel .
i called the salon and they asked i return and have the shellac redone .
i did and the following day the shellac was cracking and peeling .
this was a waste of money and especially time !
i went to this place because it was close and the reviews were good .
update : after going here for over two years , i am done .
they do n't care for good customers .
disgusting !
at one point she actually yelled at me for having my hand too stiff .
and when i say yelled i mean yelled .
it was freaking horrible .
but she did not .
do not go to this place !
if i could give zero stars i would .
the ambiance is horrible .
very depressing .
i did n't like that because if it spilled my clothes would be ruined .
um i could do that at home if i wanted to do it myself .
i 'm here because i want someone else to do it .
at this point i was really annoyed .
the pedicure was painful .
the polish job looked like a _num_ year old did it .
no drying lamps .
horrible .
gross .
waited _num_ min and nothing .
customer service was poor and they were rude .
horrible customer service !
rose shot my fill straight to hell and did not pass go .
my acrylic after she finished was uneven and not even fully covering my nail .
i would n't even give _num_ star if i could .
this place is awful .
well , i should say the lady who did my nails is awful .
but the lady who did mine was just awful .
wrong .
she was rude .
and the old gel polish she did n't even get off all the way .
i do not recommend this place .
this was a horrible experience !
she was extremely rude .
next the salon is dirty and i felt super uncomfortable .
not relaxing at all .
then she charged me half of what i would normally pay for gel nails .
horrible , horrible experience .
there is a reason this salon was empty .
the shop was dirty but i was short on time so i sat down .
i wish that i would have looked at reviews first .
i would have never gone into their shop .
not good experience .
went in for a pedicure and was disappointed .
they did n't clean the utensils before using them on the next person .
and rushed through my pedicure and did n't do a good job .
i wo n't be back .
i do n't recommend .
worst nail place i 've ever been to .
rude dirty and the worst manicure pedicure i 've ever gotten .
they look horrible !
i would say that the sushi is mediocre at best .
on top of that , the prices are far too high .
you might as well buy some pre-made sushi from the grocery store .
the rolls are way too over priced .
_num_ dollars for a philly ?
the most i 'd pay for a philly here is _num_ .
i had take out yesterday and this place was just nearby my hotel .
it was _num_ bucks but for the quality , it should be 10-15 bucks .
you would probably need the drinks to mask the poor quality of the food .
the teriyaki chicken was ok , sauce too sweet and too much of it .
i should mention here that when we walked in it smelled fishy as well .
not a good sign for a sushi place .
it was ok nothing special and a bit overpriced for what you get .
i am not new to sushi .
i would never go back to this place .
the service was horrible .
the experience was very off .
i would n't return for sit down service but maybe take out .
but alas , two weeks after going here they are closed down .
_num_ visits in the last month .
both visits were n't good .
i 'm just not a fan period .
not impressed .
i ca n't recommend this place and would n't go back .
was excited to try it but it was a complete let down .
sushi rolls were terrible !
totally wasting money .
i tried this place for lunch because it 's located right across my work .
oh my lord , it was a disaster .
_num_ star for saying `` thank you .
i ordered the tempura dinner and was very disappointed .
received a salad that had old iceberg ( brown edges ) and no dressing .
had to ask for dressing , the cook apologized saying he forgot .
ok so we 're sitting here as i type this review .
the ordering process stinks , the staff seems totally clueless .
holy gross !
i have n't been to a place this awful in a while .
the customer service is awful just to start .
i paid but will never go back and never recommend .
i order sushi and the taste was n't fresh .
it really need more improvement comparing to my last experience .
very rude service .
poor choices of sides ( e.g .
i will never go in this restaurant again .
you can get better new york food elsewhere without the new york attitude .
i passed on the potato chips and drink , so he lost $ _num_ .
i paid with a credit card , so i obviously had money .
the salad was actually decent , but the sandwich was bad .
very little meat and cheese and way too much shredded lettuce .
even while taking my money he was being sarcastic and rude .
how she puts up with him ... i have no idea !
i can guarantee i will never spend my money here again .
oh i do n't know what the big deal is .
it was probably back in _num_ the first and only time i ate there .
i could n't even finish my bbq pork sandwich , i was that disappointed .
sorry , honey bears .
bland .
for shame !
ok , i 'll admit , phoenix has terrible bbq .
but this ai n't no relative rating , and phoenix needs some better bbq .
if you like a sorry excuse for bbq , this is it .
when you walk in , there is no aroma of bbq , just meat .
sides are completely forgettable .
i gave honey bears _num_ stars because the prices are good .
i ca n't give the sandwich a passing grade .
and for _num_ bucks , i want better .
if they get that right , i 'll throw another star at them .
the pork was very dry and obviously old as were the sides .
price was ok but who cares if your meal tastes bad .
people who enjoy good bbq should avoid this place .
sorry , honey bear 's , but i 'm not feeling you .
i just can not understand why this place is so highly rated .
but even that can not be true .
just not impressed at all .
i went honey bear 's with my wife to use a groupon .
the pork was dry with no smokey flavor .
the chicken was drenched in sauce hiding the flavor .
the sides of beans and corn were nothing special as well .
this place is still as bad as it was when i first reviewed it .
i got the ribs and two nasty side items that came with it .
( _num_ stars ) .
there were several on the day i was in ... ick !
overpriced and nothing special of this bbq chicken sandwich .
the one central is not good .
food was good but service was less than stellar .
about _num_ minutes went by and no food .
woman was out of it and did n't go pick up the food .
not impressed .
now , this was n't some big styrofoam container .
there was n't anything that screamed `` have seconds ! ''
overall , it was a _num_ because nothing blew me away .
despite the overall fair reviews i was pretty disappointed with this place .
but the big problem were the ribs .
but to be soggy , wet , fatty and without any real smoky flavor ?
come on , for what i spent what a terrible value !
also the men 's room was n't too clean either .
sorry but after _num_ strikes you 're out , will never go back .
maybe i 've flown too high .
i tried the mac and cheese as well as the cole slaw .
the pork was tough and had no smoke flavor whatsoever .
the cole slaw was ok , just bland .
it was n't even worth getting my money back .
the links had no taste except were very spicy .
the food sucks .
wow , we were not just disappointed , we were disgusted .
not a fan of this location .
ordered the pork sandwich and the bread was stale .
this place has dry .
and drowning it in their boring sauce does not help things .
very sad pulled pork sandwich .
my husband and i decided to try a new place tonight .
i could n't even pick it up , the bun was so soggy .
the bbq sauce was lacking in consistency and flavor .
the cheese in the mac was a bit thin .
there are better places to spend my money .
old and dirty room , and not good home flavor .
boy was i disappointed and embarrassed .
then , to top it all off , we were overcharged .
our original order came to _num_ the groupon was for _num_ .
waited _num_ hr for a beef sandwich .
all trash cans were full and stacked with plates .
sauce container was empty with plastic forks at the bottom that had fallen in .
the food was sloppy and they had a bunch of teenagers running the business .
i got my money refunded and walked out that was my final visit .
went to central ave location .
wo n't go back , waste of money , tables were dirty too .
the bbq is n't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley .
seemed about average so naturally i prepared myself to not be impressed .
i see some obvious pride lost in the owners and employees alike .
i never like to see a business fail .
i had the bbq chicken sandwich and it was moist but not seasoned .
the cashier ruined my experience and management needs to check her attitude !
well _num_ goes by , ok i want a refund .
there would be a zero star here if i had the option .
never again honey bears will i treat you to my hard earned money .
dam i am mad .
this is just very bad bbq and poor service .
i have given it several chances and nothing has changed .
will not be going back .
my wife may go back but i never will !
no more .
not that crowded .
noticed most other customers were waiting too .
another _num_ minutes before # _num_ came out .
the cashier was dismissive - no explanation , no apology , nothing .
_num_ ( _num_ ! )
i usually stick to only good reviews but this weekend was the last straw .
this trip did n't make sense and they did n't really seem to care .
not really in a rush to go back ever at this point .
this was my first time to this place and probably the last !
well not here .
so the rude cashier looks over and says what .
go away we do n't want your money !
i 've tried their other food and its terrible .
the fried chicken and catfish had absolutely no flavor .
the bread is cold and soggy .
anything else and you 'll be really disappointed .
the sandwich was awful .
i ate the sandwich with a fork instead .
it came with _num_ sides an with tax was about $ _num_ .
the fries were ok so thats all he ate .
i liked the bbq sauce but the chicken was super dry .
the counter help was extremely rude .
this place has really lost it 's touch .
other than that i wo n't be back .
went there with my girlfriend for what i thought would be good bbq .
so it 's okay to serve bad food too ?
all he said was oh okay and walked away .
never would i think about going back and spend my money there again .
remember i did not place the order .
is n't it a given they would have my order written down ?
the worker was not rude but he was indifferent .
i just ca n't deal with bad service .
the drinks are watered down .
i knew from the previous _num_ times that i probably would not enjoy it .
hell even i came back knowing i would n't like it .
they also ran out of plates .
ridiculous .
i had _num_ bbq beef sandwiches because they were out of the pulled pork .
boiled meat covered in bbq sauce is not bbq .
i 'm really torn between _num_ and _num_ stars .
other than the employees , there were no other patrons .
my ribs were tough and the sauce seemed watered down .
overall , the food was not so good .
tolerable but not satisfying at all .
do n't get me wrong .
i did n't mind too much on how it looked .
probably have to roll up in a tank now , just to be safe .
unfortunately , we wo n't be back .
crappy bun .
a few pieces of pork tasted like paper had gotten into meat .
the mac and cheese was crap , and so not worth _num_ .
had i gotten there too early to be served yesterday 's reheated chicken ?
maybe built in _num_ and never remodeled .
the bun was a simply white bread roll , nothing special .
_num_ star for a successful pulled brisket sandwich .
i just was n't impressed .
every sandwich was on a ( fairly soggy ) standard grocery store hamburger bun .
it is n't so expensive that i would mind .
horrible customer service at this location .
it 's like they hate other black people .
angry looks and never a reply to a thank you .
customer service is always creepy .
i would warn african people and ppl of african decent not to eat here .
they do not cater to their own folks .
watery pulled pork , slaw had no flavor , and just yuck all around .
for over $ _num_ you expect something more than a soggy grocery store bun .
the cheap bun does n't support the sauce .
did the yelp check in coupon for $ _num_ off .
i guess i should 've read the reviews first .
a coworker and i went here for lunch about a week ago .
the fish had no flavor at all and it was way too crispy .
then i was told it would take another _num_ minutes .
it took over _num_ minutes before i got my food .
i threw half of it away .
big mistake .
moreover , they served me the very last serving of brisket .
the meat itself smelled horrible .
literally a faint odor of dog food .
the service was , umm , strange .
not friendly or unfriendly .
just uncomfortable .
we had eaten honey bears ribs frequently 10-15 years ago .
had n't been in such a long time .
the meat was flavorless .
the bottom bun was practically liquid .
really unpleasant .
my husband did n't want to eat his pork .
so disappointing ( and expensive ) .
i got the brisket , took _num_ bites and could n't stomach anymore .
worst bbq i every experience .
hot dogs .
i was traveling from los angeles , hoping for a good meal .
this place is garbage .
paid $ _num_ for a _num_ cent size cheeseburger from mcdonalds .
the meat was bland , tasteless .
i 'm not a big guy and the sandwich was gone in _num_ bites .
not filling at all .
tacky tables with bus stop ads in them .
bland food .
bbq sauce is nothing to write home about .
i 'm extremely disappointed that i wasted my money here .
not a fan .
i think the meats are boiled and not smoked .
everything was loose and chewy and over cooked to a mush .
do n't eat here .
we paid _num_ for lunch for two ; so not worth it .
the meat had no flavor whatsoever not even salt .
the only thing that was n't so bad were the fries .
i gave it one star because of the fries .
sub-par pulled pork sandwich .
no real bbq ( smokey ) taste .
the bun was pretty cheap and mushy after being soaked through .
bbq sauce was nothing special .
i wo n't be back .
prices are too high for standard fare .
it was terrible !
they did n't even have chicken available when we ate there .
( i realized this when i saw the bill next day ) .
forget it .
not worth it .
if i had stuck with that i might have had a very different experience .
the pumpkin bread pudding was good , but not worth making a trip for .
speaking of service , let 's not .
we got there at _num_ pm , the place was completely empty .
the beer was papago orange blossom ( which is glorious ! )
, and then screw over your customers , absolutely ridiculous .
you lost a long time customer and fan .
several of us went today for easter brunch - big disappointment .
the restaurant was not that busy - took _num_ minutes between courses being served .
the server never should have brought that plate to the table .
another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland .
horrible customer service !
strangely rude and condescending .
it ruined our experience and vibe of the place .
poor service , poor choices .
disappointing to say the least .
we left confused by the entire experience .
when the plate came they were not on it .
this time a waste of time and money .
lights kept going out , iced tea never got refilled .
but this last time , it was not good at all .
not to mention that it was so loud we could n't hear each other .
all around disappointing .
( nothing like the wine we wanted that we 've had before ) .
worse , the food started to change in unpleasant ways .
just not worth the money .
the risotto it was served with was terrible .
it was hard and just not appealing .
the filet mignon was cooked well but not seasoned at all .
there 's just too many other options now to continue to be underwhelmed .
i wo n't be back .
yes , i do believe every restaurant deserves a second chance .
was not impressed at all .
the short rib was alright , nothing special at all .
the polenta was too thick and a bit cold .
they seem to be trying too hard to be something they are not .
will not be back .
and then never returned to take my order .
nothing special .
i was just at a wine dinner tonight .
$ _num_ for four courses and four wines .
went here for easter brunch .
paid way too much for a meal that left me feeling hungry .
it was like eating outside , except we were indoors .
my biggest complaint is that the food is n't that great .
it is _num_ star food with _num_ star prices .
there is no beer on tap and service takes a long time .
the atmosphere is not bad , pretty much expected for a wine bar .
the situation at the door just was n't handled very well .
that is not a caesar salad .
that is not bruschetta .
my companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates .
i was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there .
i 'm rating this of my initial experience with this place and my disappointment .
the prickly pear margarita was very small .
az restaurant week inspired me to try a new place .
but our guy , uh ... not so much .
it appeared the az restaurant week menu was our only option for dinner .
i was disappointed in all our selections .
neither dish had much flavor .
overall , i was disappointed .
not my idea of a cool wine bar at all .
atmosphere was blah .
it had not ambiance no style , nothing going for it .
it was not cool to even be in there .
otherwise the place was not even worth wasting space in my brain to remember .
with that said - the port tasting was a disaster !
go not go there for tastings !
the pours were so uneven they ran out of port for several people !
obviously these people know nothing about wine pairings .
do not go to this restaurant !
my best tip is writing a review and simply not going back .
nothing worse than eating and freezing at the same time !
unfortunately , they are out of business .
looks like they closed their doors only a few days ago .
too bad .
sadly i 've never really had good food or drinks here .
they were cool for a week but that week has long passed .
in fact , its just pretty generic .
i find nothing appealing about this place .
but nothing to get myself worked up about .
or worse .
the bread and bacon were practically dripping in grease .
the food is bland .
the big unit -- bland .
nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food .
that 's one disappointing appetizer .
the corn beef on my sandwich was tough .
it was dead inside .
it was the worst margarita i 've ever had .
surprisingly small size portion cut very thin .
the service was suck though .
not worth the drive from nor phx .
good food - but horrible service .
when we were , we ordered beer and wine .
our waiter dropped off my boyfriend 's beer .
it was not the one he ordered .
so , he ordered another beer .
when my food arrived , it had lettuce and tomato on it .
but , had i been that would have been an issue .
the only good thing about our experience .
there was two different color credit cards , not sure how this even happened .
we were very very very unhappy with our visit .
needless to say , good food - the worst service i have ever experienced .
dry fish , cheddar cheese and lemon ?
this place i had mixed feeling about .
all of my dish was served at a room temperature .
i went here with my friend for lunch .
it was n't organized at all .
then my friend ordered a beer on tap and that did n't work .
so she just ordered a bottle which was $ _num_ .
i was very disappointed and will not return here .
if you like crappy service and frozen , reheated food then go for it .
first thing the hours and parking situation are terrible .
finally had our chance and we were disappointed .
it was bad , i was expecting nathan 's !
as far as the toppings a+ , the baguette roll a+ .
our service was not any better .
our waitress noticed we had n't received anything yet and went to go check .
a little too late .
the food was nothing special but not the worst i 've had .
but , the food , that is another story .
drinks only ok !
_num_ words describes this place : tourist trap .
unless you are looking for drinks , save your money .
hot dog was flavorless and chilli was bland .
anyway , along comes the food .
the _num_ year old said `` what the heck is that ?
he did n't like it much and i do n't really blame him .
ah well , _num_ dollar sandwich down the drain .
the fries were just like burger king fries ... not so yummy .
each side is a dollar , by t he way .
way too salty .
we could n't even hear each other talking .
such a disappointment .
you can buy apparel , cups and more at the counter .
very loud .
the restrooms are not clean .
i know they 're busy but they 're neglected just like the tables .
service is bad .
after a while it gets annoying .
she said that she would have to charge us for another one .
it took us forever to get the next one and it was cold !
i was really disappointed at my experience here .
the big disappointment , though , was the food .
i got the bbq sampler thing and my husband got nachos .
now the not do good ... .
welcome to alice 's overpriced tourist trap nightmare !
food is expensive and totally tasteless .
the fish fry and fish tacos were the worst .
seriously , $ _num_ for _num_ skimpy , dry pieces of fried fish ?
the fries where some of the worst i have had !
dont fall for the trap like me !
this place sucks .
do n't go there unless you are very patient .
wednesday was _num_ % off their salads and meatloaf .
my salad was disgusting , to be frank .
not worth it .
go for a beer but not a meal .
well all i can tell you is shame on you .
firstly the food was horrible .
are you freaking kidding me.
what the hell kind of response is that ?
i would never ever let my restaurant get to that point .
it 's really not a bad place to watch a game .
with a few changes it could be a _num_ star joint .
horrible experience .
gross !
i ordered a turkey sandwich .
just awful .
do n't waste your time or money !
why bother ... ... the food is mediocre at best .
non attentive staff , very rude bartender .
left before getting waited on !
yucky i did n't think the food was very tasteful and it was overpriced .
the place was packed too .
you do n't have any bottles back there ?
- the restrooms are like gas station restrooms .
they could n't handle the crowd of people at the party .
- service is slow .
overall , not a good experience .
horrible !
avoid at all costs , unless you are a die hard alice cooper fan .
and if you are there as a fan do n't eat the food .
service is slow & totally apathetic .
it has a huge outdoor patio area , plus balcony , plus indoor seating .
unfortunately there were no grilled veggies in it !
it was filled about _num_ % with lettuce and raw , red onion .
too bad .
the food was nothing more than mediocre for the price .
place is pretty cool as far as decoration but the food was awful .
worst barbecue ever .
had the food been terrible , i would have gone zero .
that makes it really simple for everyone .
for a football event i went to , they were offering breakfast .
as for drinks , they really are just overpriced .
i know they have rent , i get it .
horrible pricing decision .
i would 've had an extra beer but this turned me off immediately .
nothing else to say , just too expensive for what you are getting !
atmosphere is ok , it could be so much better .
well , it sat on our table for _num_ hours after being finished .
so , service was bad .
i have made suggestions for other locations , and those suggestions stand .
wrong .
complete and total let down .
alice cooper , you should be ashamed .
there was basically zero wait staff .
there was no wait service - at all .
it is a shame the rest of the competition is being held there .
the kids deserve so much better .
the food was dry and the employees horrible !
the club sandwich was dry and lacked flavor .
she ignored us and talked over my husband to other people .
my buffalo chicken wrap was minus the buffalo !
my wrap was n't even hot .
had an order of _num_ chicken wings with the sauce on the side .
way too much batter on the wings .
however , the roll was extremely dry ( stale ? )
typical selection of beers and drinks .
i choose the fries and the nightmare chili .
it was an extremely disappointing dining experience .
i ate them and it filled my stomach .
the check was $ _num_ , and matt got no tip .
first time i actually checked in on yelp .
this is just a noisy sports bar .
but otherwise , meh , i 've experienced better .
went here while in phx on business with a friend who lives locally .
no such luck .
nothing seemed like real bbq just over cooked and tasteless .
they only give a small cup of bbq sauce for your meal .
huge disappointment !
what a waste of money !
second of all , the food was absolutely not worth the money .
we ordered their signature hot dog , the hamburger sliders and cheese fries .
it was disgusting .
needless to say , we will never return !
service is n't the best plus you have to pay $ _num_ to park .
very greasy and food tastes like it was not fresh and prepared and frozen .
bbq meat tasted old .
been there plenty of times before .
all visits alright , not exceptional though .
minutes passed , some people escorted her to the bathroom , brought her back .
obviously , i had lost my appetite .
what a shitty experience , i will never go there again .
it had a nice atmosphere , but the food left much to be desired .
when we sat down we waited _num_ minutes before waiter came by .
this time was worse then before .
we got _num_ slices of brisket and _num_ slices of turkey .
we sent it back and the food runner got pissed and gave us attitude .
but he did n't do anything until we complained .
so disappointed !
staying in tempe but made the short trip into phoenix specifically to go here .
mike , the bartender , waited on me .
not very friendly .
being a vegetarian , there are n't many choices for me on the menu .
nothing really stood out with my meal .
everything was pretty mediocre .
wo n't be back when visiting again .
it was n't happy hour and my draft bud light was $ _num_ .
i give this place _num_ star only because i like alice cooper .
rude , slow and unorganized hostess staff .
waited _num_ hrs and never served .
what a complete waste of time .
i have been here before and never have i experienced bad service .
no wait time , seated us fast .
waiter screwed up on my drink order but did correct it the 2nd time .
waited another _num_ minutes for her simple cheese crisp to come out .
sent the pulled pork back was cold when brought out .
so rude !
what did i miss to receive the crap service .
will i be back ... no !
the decor and wait staff are interesting and service was average .
i ordered a salad with grilled chicken .
i could have received a better salad at mcdonald 's .
the lettuce was wilted and looked straight out of a bag .
half the chicken was cold and half was warm .
bbq beans from a can , served in tiny plastic cups .
i did n't even get my food order !
so i had to wait another _num_ min !
looking around i feel sad for he people who eat this bbq .
in alice cooper i do not trust .
the waitress and/or kitchen got our order wrong .
really not anything special .
so it 's an ok place & glad i went .
i got no time for tears it 's just another touristy restaurant .
not much else to say about this place .
my thought was actually it does , because i was paying for them .
finally got a table and the waitress was awful .
food was cold , over priced for what we got .
wo n't be back .
the food was not good .
i really would n't recommend this place .
maybe get a beer but not the food .
love ac 's music but the food at his restaurant was awful .
the rest of the meats were serve cold .
if i 'm buying a premium drink it should be served in a glass .
only to be completely let down .
there was no merchandise to purchase , no glasses , no shirts , etc .
it was burnt and embarrassing to receive .
a little ghetto in areas .
the waitress was not attentive to our drinks .
unfortunately my experience was less than par .
very disappointing experience .
i had their green chili burrito , no flavor , do n't order it .
my husband and i shared the big unit and `` meh '' .
it 's not terribly flavorful , and the toppings are blah .
we came , we saw , we wo n't be back .
waste of time .
beer was n't cold .
now , it 's run down , dirty and the food tastes old .
looks like i went to the wrong place .
it was edible , but not enjoyable .
this place is not even mediocre .
actually i take that partially back , the chips and salsa were good .
i could n't even pick up a slice without it completely falling apart .
this one little thing would improve this place immensely .
quick and easy , not good and cheap .
talk about bad mexican food .
wo n't be going back .
after the game we stopped again , same thing .
pretty terrible all around .
food tasteless , salsa weak , margs weak and watery .
atmosphere very loud , ( game night ) and still only about half full .
only redeeming quality was patron shots .
would n't go back .
but tonight two really disappointing things happened .
we were told ) and only _num_ small bowls of chips for _num_ people .
very sad to think it was taken .
smell is horrible !
i was buying so i told him to get what ever he wanted .
service was first rate - amy is a rock star .
i would not order the two taco lunch again .
ok thats fine except there is nowhere to sit and the view is lame .
everything else is what you would expect from an older covered basketball stadium .
sorry phoenix this `` ai n't '' it .
ok i am biased .
i could hardly tell it was music let alone actually hear anything .
the sound was so bad that i feel they ripped me off .
had a terrible time .
however , the sound was ridiculously loud to the point of hurting your ears .
the security experience was horrible & piss poor to say the least .
first off the doors to the show did n't open until _num_ pm .
the lines were incredibly long .
it took _num_ minutes or longer to get into the building .
it could have been a very ugly scene outside .
absolutely ridiculous !
we had just walked from our car to the venue .
are you kidding me ?
they took them away and were rude and sarcastic the whole time .
a _num_ ounce water bottle .
i would make a fortune , i 'm sure .
not in phoenix .
very disappointed !
there were hardly any concessions to choose from for food and drinks .
for $ _num_ i could n't believe it .
worst ever .
cops and security have attitudes and are rude despite family event .
really ?
this is one of the worst run places i have ever been to .
_num_ lbs .
`` guest experience '' i will never ever go to this terrible place again .
this might be the worst venue to see a concert in the entire us .
acoustics are horrible just horrible and make listening to the music painful .
oh and you 'll pay $ _num_ for a beer .
the place has one big problem , the acoustics were terrible .
and it was $ _num_ for a soda .
do not stay here .
last fall my husband had a terrible experience with this hotel .
poor customer service !
even thought that was our last drink there , it still pissed us off .
epic failure !
the hostess was equally clueless .
the place was only a third full at most .
no reason for the extremely poor service .
ca n't wait until sliders opens for the season !
this tgi fridays is an epic failure !
worst customer service ever !
before sitting down we asked a waiter if the table was available .
when she brought me my check back the receipt with the survey was gone .
i asked where it went and she was n't sure .
horrible experience .
no one else is there , not their fault but still weird .
no reason the place is empty !
only reason this gets _num_ stars is it 's connected to the baseball stadium .
the place was not busy at all .
empty tables everywhere .
completely lame .
but horrible service .
the restaurant had no more than _num_ tables sat .
there was a ton of employees working and service was still slow .
then the manager finally came and sat us at a regular table .
literally had to tell her every aspect of her job , step by step .
we walked in , and the restaurant was completely empty .
we ordered , and _num_ minutes later our meals arrived .
i left a _num_ dollar tip and still feel that i was generous .
horrible !
not real busy inside .
waiter tried to sit us at a table that was in the sun .
his attitude was fairly arrogant .
way too many places downtown now where your patronage will be appreciated .
wrong .
the food was horrible .
fries were cold .
thumbs down .
do n't go here on a game day .
there 's no happy hour which is why we went .
thumbs down .
there 's no all you can appetizers cause of the game .
left paying over _num_ for sodas and _num_ meals .
thumbs down .
another _num_ minutes went by before he came back to take the order .
the waiter seemed apologetic afterwards but i do n't think i will be back .
do n't waste your money with this place .
very disappointing considering our bill was _num_ each times _num_ people .
very bad experience .
no big deal we did n't ask for it .
at this point we are more then ready to leave and never come back .
the chicken appetizer my wife ordered was barely warm .
needless to say - i was not happy !
the food was disappointing and the service was horrible .
and this experience makes me wish we had eaten the concession food ... .
saturday night game , no reservation .
first off , there is n't anywhere to wait .
there are no benches or chairs .
the hostesses and waiters were all under _num_ .
it was a mess , with zero organization .
fyi it is n't the full friday 's menu so some favorites are missing .
hopefully we have better luck next time .
oh and did i mention that there was no baseball game going on ?
i had hands down the worst experience i 've ever had at a restaurant .
from the bad service to the bad manners .
i 've been in multiple times and i was severely disappointed .
absolutely horrible service today .
i was left speechless .
a free desert did n't make this a better experience .
worst service ever !
ordered steak and waiter did n't ask how wanted it done .
while the food and atmosphere were great , our waiter was anything but .
from the minute we were seated matt , was awful and rude .
we had _num_ people in our party , and _num_ orders were wrong .
pay attention people or get off yelp .
a lot left to be desired .
i had the bourbon chicken , meh !
came on the side , in a little dish , i mean little .
the sweet potato fries ... limp and not crispy .
this is not a mom and pop shop that closes when its slow .
this double standard makes me never want to go there again .
their are other options , like hard rock cafe .
terrible experience .
it was terrible .
the next negative i want to bring up is the full menu .
i ordered the california club sandwich , it was disgusting .
needless to say , two bites and i was done .
sad to say i will never go back or suggest to anyone .
this place could be really great , but unfortunately as of now it sucks .
do not do business with these liars and thieves . )
i was just sent to the start of the _num_ menu again .
she comes off rude and she is a bitch !
worst customer service ever !
welcome to impersonal banking at its lowest .
very unprofessional and rude employees .
this is not sour grapes because of that .
they did n't have one of those bartenders .
they had apps too , that ranged from $ _num_ to $ _num_ .
overall , we do not recommend this establishment .
refused late checkout though the hotel did not seem busy at all .
no hot water .
the carpet was old looking and coffee left something to be desired .
i would n't stay here again .
horrible hotel !
my room was dirty .
i had low expectations of the hotel , which turned out to be accurate .
flat screen tv with standard cable channels .
no fan in the bathroom .
toilet leaked water onto floor .
very loud air conditioning unit .
hallway noise could be heard in the room .
curtains did not fully block out street light .
breakfast selection limited compared to most hotels .
the worst hotel i 've stayed in , in my entire life .
the new room had its own new problems and new stains .
i was forced to stick it out for the remaining of my business trip .
again , this was my experience with quality inn and suites .
so dallas g and i were thinking of a lunch spot .
feta or no feta ?
it has little cheese and is not flaky .
the gyro meat tastes like ... nothing .
anyway , the restaurant pretty much blew .
is he gon na hate it ?
your last name is greek .
well , that was stupid .
i hate giving two star reviews to family owned restaurants .
not because of the taste .
`` it 's not offensive . ''
_num_ % completely underwhelming .
i did n't want to rate it _num_ ( meh .
they get packed for lunch and have lots of chicago shit on the walls .
the quality was crap and it was $ _num_ .
- awful gyro meat .
- the sauce was mediocre .
it 's homemade , but that does n't mean it has to be mediocre .
- fries are n't anything special .
maybe too fast since they gave me so little meat .
my husband and i ate here after i purchased a groupon .
while the food was not bad , i definitely will not return .
this place was n't bad , but it also was n't good .
i 'm just not sure what else there is to be said .
weak .
little out of the way , but way better and you wont leave hungry .
save your time & money and go elsewhere .
the exhibits in this museum are severely lacking in the second half .
`` this is how a house is built .
anyway i feel this place needs more exhibits for adults to enjoy .
disappointing .
the few unique exhibits were very underwhelming .
the race exhibit seemed like a huge waste of space .
the digital world might have been interesting in _num_ .
big miss on their part and more than a few irritated people .
man , the science center has gone downhill !
first of all , this place is expensive !
how much more boring can an exhibit be ?
i thought that was lame .
it was interesting but i was a little disappointed .
i was bored .
this was god awful .
this was totally lost .
this exhibit was not worth the $ _num_ in my opinion .
you can not give zero stars on yelp but zero is the reality .
this is a review only for our student field trip booking experience .
warning -- - do n't do it .
there is absolutely no excuse for this .
most disappoint museum experience ever .
i 've never been to a museum where they had only three exhibits .
besides that the information presented was short and not in depth .
in short i would n't waste my money here .
so they did n't fail completely .
so why only two stars ?
parking was confusing .
there was also a special exhibit that would have been $ _num_ additional dollars .
holy crap !
the employees were n't very friendly .
so not worth paying for , glad i did n't .
the layout of the place is confusing .
nothing really makes sense in the layout .
way too expensive .
in the first place , it was supposed to be a free event .
our ears ringing , we wandered around visiting the exhibits .
some did n't work at all .
the heartbeat drum was cute , i guess .
this place has gone down hill .
totally boring , i am glad my trip there was free .
after two hours , we were done .
there , we would visit a dozen times per year .
i think that this museum just feels tired and limited .
too bad .
which seems huge but not really considering the size of phoenix .
just overall blah : ( sadly disappointed and i will definitely not be returning .
could n't get near the exhibits .
really poor sound control .
so glad i wasted $ _num_ on the groupon .
( what finish would you chose for your bathroom ?
why does any child care about that ? )
and any additional attractions are more money .
such a ripoff .
went early and could not see the displays .
such a disappointment .
never had a more unpleasant time with my kids than today .
did n't like it .
it 's a shame it only caters to children .
and even then it 's not that great for what they charge .
skip it .
in fact , the experience as a whole is not worth the money .
for two student tickets and two special exhibits , i paid nearly $ _num_ .
past that age , and they would be bored .
if i could give _num_ stars , i would .
turns out the feature was n't playing .
they should really change the name of this place to the arizona kids place .
went to renew membership and left happy i did n't .
oddly enough two employees were feet from where he fell .
ppl like michelle work at the az science center .
i 'm assuming michelle just does n't like kids .
i would not recommend this company .
my car became disabled in my garage .
called this towing company on the recommendation from my car dealer .
ugh .
does n't anybody give good customer service anymore ?
valley towing company was the worst company i ever have .
however , the next service took almost two hours for them to arrived .
but as we knew , their services were super slow .
i would not recommend this company to do the towing .
this is the worst experience i 've ever had with a tow company .
shady business practices all around .
because that is what all reputable operations do , run on a cash basis .
my dr 's ma , was loud and obnoxious !
he had the worst bedside manner i have ever seen !
he did not want to hear any of my symptoms .
we ordered online + _num_ star .
the website said that it would take _num_ minutes - _num_ star .
they have blue cheese + _num_ star .
they were breaded and had something sweet and sticky on it - _num_ star .
then he had the nerve to ask me if we still wanted it .
_num_ stars .
pizza is inconsistent .
_num_ out of _num_ times it 's anything but !
an apology would have been more appreciated then a sarcastic comment !
i do n't recommend going to this pizza hut .
the service is worse then the neighborhood it sits in .
i wish there was a negative star i could rate this place .
this was such a rip off .
i ordered two medium sized pizza with thin crust .
now , image that being cooked with toppings and passed off as pizza !
he had a complete lack of empathy or customer service at all .
manager is totally incompetent and has no idea how to use a computer !
( i just threw up in my mouth a bit . )
i 'll bet that is the real reason jared lost all that weight .
not happy subway .
and get your teeth cleaned !
that yucky yellow stuff is called tartar and it can be removed .
they 're better off just not saying it all if it is not sincere .
i have been to this subway at 16th st and thomas many times .
their hours posted on their door even say they should have been open .
the first time it happened i just blew it off .
it 's sad that where i live there 's a _num_ year waiting list .
sad , especially for the children that really need the program .
this hospital is way worse than banner desert in mesa .
instead of treating your patients better , just fill them up with more pills .
is your stomach hurting ?
for people with insurance , such as myself , it was a horrific experience .
the care we received was substandard .
it 's not like she brought a diamond ring and left it lying around .
we would not come back here or encourage people to come here .
there are hospitals that provide better service in our opinion .
( _num_ ) resident physicians were not a positive experience .
we did n't feel comfortable in their care .
would have preferred not to have dealt with residents .
( _num_ ) billing office was difficult .
instead of going home that morning , we did n't leave until _num_ pm .
no `` excuse me '' or anything !
not cool .
i was literally in so much pain that i could n't even sit down .
i 'm not kidding .
these people do n't care about anyone especially the elderly .
overall many doctors and nurses were helpful in the care of my mom .
they have everyone in this one room waiting for hours .
it 's not sanitary and the staff is very rude .
if i can give this hospital zero stars i would .
horrible !
now i know why physician groups do not link themselves to facilities .
i would never get care here .
the quality of care is very poor .
worst experience ever !
first baby having their in _num_ and i almost die !
i was n't sure of what to do about it .
by far the worst hospital i have ever been to in my life .
avoid this hospital at all costs !
doctors are exceptional , nurses are ok , the hospital itself is unacceptable .
rooms were small , uncomfortable and unbelievably dirty .
i was given a blanket that smell very badly .
again poor communication and rude staff were present there .
wo n't recommend .
actually i would not encourage anyone to go here .
that seems so biased and very misleading !
i did n't even recognize any of the former employees .
i 'm sure you will leave disappointed .
two thumbs down to this lemon !
boy , was i sorry .
gross , i know , but so was this meat .
after eating there once , i doubt that i will ever go again .
the meat was ok but the taco itself was very greasy .
my husband ordered two enchiladas , one machaca and one chicken .
the one thing about the reviews that was correct : service is not great .
we are white , and the others getting better service are hispanic .
it was so disgusting i could n't even eat it .
skip this joint !
disappointing .
on a friday night at 7:30 , it was less than half full .
our waitress was one of the most surly servers i 've ever had anywhere .
no greeting , no smile , no eye contact .
they just do n't give a damn .
very odd and not really nice at all .
no complaints at all .
there are not many vegetarian options , which is normally ok for me .
i 'm not difficult to please .
i was surprised how mediocre it was .
even the margarita just was n't that flavorful .
horrible experience .
the food was oily and the service sucked .
food is still great but the service was terrible !
we were very disappointed .
i tried this place for the first time for the raved about menudo .
not spectacular , but it satisfied my pregnancy craving for menudo .
the only set back was that it took forever to get the menudo .
that and the service was not good .
the server barely came around or not at all to check on us .
you get what you pay for , which is not much here .
have had better and also worse .
but check your bill before paying .
that does n't sit well in my book .
i also ran into the slow refill issue that others mention .
the experience started out lousy .
the food sucked and the service was substandard , i will not return .
tried this place and it was the worst food ever .
the food is horrible !
last night we tried the shrimp fajitas and were very disappointed !
no sizzling hot skillet here !
just a bland cold plate with tiny shrimps , some not cleaned .
chips and salsa were really good , but beware the chips cost $ _num_ .
the rice was super bland and had no flavor .
the salsa was weird .
even the chips was bland !
annoying .
maybe dine-in would be a better way to experience rosita 's .
once seated , it took forever to get service .
took another _num_ minutes after that just to get the bill !
when i got home , i fed the leftovers to the chickens !
after this , i was never going back !
i told him it would be a mistake ... it was !
again , hard to get service .
there are about _num_ tables and _num_ waitresses !
server was the reason why i did n't do a one star .
food was very mediocre .
hashbrowns came out with no color and soggy .
sent them back , they came back with no color and soggy .
asked for chorizo with fried eggs , but got it all scrambled .
not busy btw .
tamales were old and tough as leather .
ok , if i could do two and half stars i would .
service was slow .
disappointed .
i could sense she wanted no part of my family 's need .
the service was bad .
the waitress had a bad attitude .
i do n't know what was her problem , but she was unpleasant .
also , the waitress got our order wrong on my friend 's dish .
the waitress was also difficult to find .
they charge for chips and sauce on top of the burrito .
it was different , but it did n't taste good .
i wo n't be going back .
the reason why is because their service is terrible .
people around us were sitting down , eating , then leaving .
took to yelp to help us out and we were sadly let down .
let me just say , i 'm not cheap ( swear ! )
i just hate getting ripped off .
dumb .
we left both our meals on the table and will not be back .
thanks yelpers , following advice of others is not always good .
the horchata was decent but that was the only positive about this meal unfortunately .
how hard is it to screw up a taco ?
and sell hungry but will opt out of yelp for dinner tonight .
_num_ stars .
the absolute worst bar in town , let alone the worst gay bar .
_num_ toilets in the ladies room , last nite one was broke .
this place by far is the worst bar i 've ever been to !
they are all rude !
you can not have fun at this place because they will kick you out !
the service is always horrible , the dj sucks and the people are rude .
this guy is awful .
i went to him for _num_ visits over months .
he told me nothing was wrong with me .
i never asked for pain medication yet was treated poorly .
this man cares nothing about your pain .
he -- does not -- care about the patients whatsoever .
appalling conditions .
the showers and bathrooms are completely disgusting .
i would have rather relieved myself outdoors .
they run the place more like a business rather than a care facility .
it was painful to see .
the food is also disgusting .
the only thing that did n't taste gross was the fruit and the drinks .
even the oatmeal is gross .
he was arrogant as well and spoke down to every patient .
i will never ever go back to this horrible place .
do n't even say that in-n-out is better .
the first time , they gave me a whole grilled jalapeno .
they got the onions , cheese , and bacon right though .
the people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected .
i ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink .
but as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place .
the meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour .
the onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy .
i tired it and that is enough .
if i could , i would not even give the food _num_ star .
food !
after one bit of my grilled chicken sandwich , i instantly regretted going here .
it was disgusting .
amongst the worst fast food burgers .
what in the world is that crap you call a bun ?
easily the worst bun on earth .
whataburger is n't .
it 's far , far , far worse than that .
gross .
still awful .
how the heck could anybody like this place ?
_num_ stars because it is n't mcdonalds , although mcdonalds has better buns .
slow as hell .
i 'd rather give my money to another business .
wondering if it was made last dinner rush .
the drive thru is _num_ minutes for each car that 's in it .
i was really excited to finally try whataburger .
more like what a disappointment .
maybe it was just too hyped .
i made an appointment for _num_ pm on a friday for my friend .
it did n't look like she was too far into it either .
crap .
_num_ minutes later she is back to my friend .
then from out of nowhere the stylists son starts going off the handle .
evil happens .
_num_ minutes later , the other stylist had to finally take over .
actually , there would have been no _num_ minutes !
we left _num_ hours later .
then hit you with a $ _num_ fee without hesitation .
take the good with the bad .
it was disgusting .
my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it .
the chips were stale .
so why only two star ?
parking was very limited due to the construction .
the window in my room looked into the backyard of someone 's home .
manager comped us the room , but i slept badly and was horrified !
one star is far more than they deserve .
the owner ruined the entire experience .
the part where this goes bad is the management .
rude managers combined with a shabby hotel in a sketchy neighborhood .
i would n't stay here again if you paid me .
this time it was not .
when we got to our room my wife found dead roaches in the bathroom .
did n't give me a refund since i booked through expedia .
i would rather drive the _num_ miles home instead of sleeping in this place .
no roaches there .
my advice to phoenix visitors , avoid this place .
my veggie burrito was almost $ _num_ and not very appetizing .
a co-worker was very disappointed also .
it seemed like a bunch of toppings thrown together with chips and ranch dressing .
we also use this place to cater meal for our late working employees .
the catered food was a lot better than my burrito .
seems more often than not , something is missing from my combination dinners .
it 's too bad .
friendly staff too !
it 's not that great .
it was dry and it tasted like paper .
very off .
actually , nothing it the burro was the least bit warm .
but again , i was starving at this point so i took it down .
i knew immediately that something was wrong .
big mistake .
i consider myself to have an iron gut , too .
not cool .
i really do n't think i 'll be back .
but our burritos were not great .
what is so hard about having the whole thing heated through ?
i do n't understand why people eat here .
i am from mexico , and even the street restaurants are better than this .
the red sauce has sooo much flour in it you could taste it .
suffice it to say i was offended and promptly cancelled the order .
and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill , terrible .
it was all really inedible as was the menudo that my girlfriend ordered .
disgusting .
also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers , very weird place .
i am sure it sucks though and i will never go back .
not good .
i can get pass the decor if the food was good .
no flavor unless you add the sauce ( a lot ) !
from my experience tonight , the rumors may be true .
not so here .
i got the shredded chicken and the carnitas tacos .
soft corn tortillas , of course .
no flavor on either - i guess they really rely on their salsa bar .
i was never called back , emailed , nothing .
they were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery , flavorless sauce .
even with soy sauce added , they did nothing for me .
i 'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on yelp seemed pretty good .
i had a few bites and lost my appetite .
my boyfriends meal ( forget what he got ) was no better .
i wo n't be going back .
still _num_ out of the _num_ dishes we ordered is n't a good record .
but whatever i order seems boring and uninspired .
i was disappointed that it was just white rice with bits of egg .
and the rice still tasted more steamed than fried .
anyway , i was glad last year that they fixed up the decor .
i have not been back since .
not impressed whatsoever .
everything here tasted a little off , and it was very expensive .
as for the main dishes , they lack taste .
nothing was good , i 'm sad to report .
my husband ordered the bell pepper chicken , which was just ok .
not a fan .
had the sesame chicken lunch combo and did not like it at all .
the chicken was hard and the sauce was n't good .
it was just not a good experience .
the chicken egg roll was very greasy .
my main dish was the cashew chicken .
the flavor was bland , so i decided to add chili paste .
it was hot , but tasteless .
gross , gross , gross .
with several pathetic pieces of onions .
thats mongolian beef for the ghetto house of hong kong .
this is not chinese food .
my third timing coming .
i will not be back .
food is unfortunately mediocre not what we thought .
i ordered the shrimp lo mein with lobster sauce .
mmm , sounds yummy but the ramen noodles just blew it for me .
for crying out loud , ramen ?
the restaurant was set up kinda weird .
the place could use a little updating and tlc .
downright horrendous .
just tasted like a ton of vinegar without any quality or flavor .
well , this hot and sour soup was disgusting .
worst customer service ever .
the tables were dirty and breaking apart the chairs were filthy .
do n't bother with this place .
i want to see my doctor in a white coat .
i hate doctors who have a business in addition to their practice .
people die in surgery centers .
i was exhausted , had been out of work for several weeks .
was facing back surgery and trying to find a surgeon .
maybe that was true , but he would not be doing this on me .
no problem , just schedule me for another appointment .
not so fast .
no problem , can i pay it when i show for the next appointment ?
it 's $ _num_ people .
this place has really gone downhill in the last few years .
they do not return phone calls or emails .
this is a disgrace .
cook sitting on the counter dirty .
flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty .
i 'm giving welcome diner _num_ star for the service .
the food was pretty good but the experience just ruined everything else .
why let that ruin my lunch ?
disgusting .
the burger was dry and not tasty .
the food was good ( not great ) but the ambiance was totally unacceptable .
they had a dj playing music at an obnoxious volume .
if i were a neighbor we would have a real problem .
as it is , i will most definitely not be a return customer .
what a disappointment .
they took way too long to make a grilled cheese sandwich .
not only was the grilled cheese hot , it was also extremely small .
pathetic .
do n't waste your time .
not my favorite , but fries are fries .
it was dropping and the bun got instantly soggy .
we will not be back .
they do n't believe in customer service at the welcome diner .
this place is a hell hole .
do n't really see what all of the buzz is about .
the only issue i had is their food is not that good i felt .
like everyone said the wait time for your food is truly ridiculous .
would i be back ?
really good looking menu but the execution really failed .
with one window taking all of the orders , it was painfully slow .
our food did n't arrive for another _num_ minutes .
yes , an hour and forty total .
brutal .
my burger was good but the fries were awful .
poorly done .
service was non-existent so we were ignored .
_num_ dollar whiskey and soda the whiskey and sour ended up being _num_ dollars .
total should have been _num_ bucks .
will not frequent this location again .
you ca n't pay me to come back there .
drinking , drinking , drinking .
there is zero energy .
no talking .
no laughing .
was i expecting too much ?
it was the most depressing experience .
this is clearly where strippers go to die .
the place was surprisingly active for a wednesday afternoon .
like , where the hell did they come from ?
i dont think i 'd ever get a dance here .
this is the worst strip club i have ever been to .
nothing , and i mean nothing is as bad as this club .
the girls here are downright disgusting .
it would be negative one if it were an option .
even the overpriced bourbon street would be a better bet than this .
on name alone we had to check this place out , just for kicks .
one , quite simply because he was bored and someone paid for it .
it was time to leave ... quickly .
save the time and trouble and go elsewhere .
blonde bartender cutest of bunch to bad she did n't dance .
yes , this place is hood .
it is a random thursday , and have waited an hour now .
if they were n't so good in every other regard i would change doctors .
if my friend raved so much about them then how bad could they be ?
completely unbelievable !
she told me she would check into it and call me back .
total cost _num_ .
day of surgery they had two male assistance that flew in from cali .
total and epic fail .
shame on me i guess .
they had not left a message so i was curious and called back .
i was informed a doctor would call me back.
i am very very disappointed with the lack of care , consideration .
i wouldnt consider this a horrible place .
four hours pass and no call .
the nurse called back and was horribly rude and condescending .
nine days pass and no call .
it 's now been two weeks , southwest has never called about my records .
i do n't know why nobody at southwest could do this for me .
i will not return and would not recommend to anyone .
from early on i was not impressed with the front desk clerks .
she is certainly not in the correct profession .
they saw me april _num_ , _num_ .
this visit was nothing more than q & a .
needless to say they wanted me to test every _num_ hours .
because the bleeding was so light , i believed her and went home .
i lost it .
tears would not stop .
i was given two completely different answers which made me not trust these people .
it was pretty gross .
for $ _num_ , i could 've gotten much better mexican food somewhere else .
the foods are not the same as they used to be .
the service we had was terrible when we went for breakfast one morning .
i wonder if they are having trouble with thier managers .
what a horrible horrible place .
i had _num_ of weed in my car .
since they have the power to refuse service to their customers , be careful !
the general staff are completely incompetent and unhelpful .
so , the plan was to drop off the car after work on friday .
well , i am glad i did that because it is definately not .
it is not a dentist office !
are you kidding me ?
do not get your car fixed here !
zero stars indeed !
used this company through my appliance warranty .
but again , it was repaired and it was repaired properly .
not at all true .
bad reviews here and other sites are well earned .
proceeded to charge me the $ _num_ service charge and left .
i called american ice machines , they send out a technician the same day .
all of their service contacts are horrible .
do n't deal with these people if you have a choice .
tech was not interested at all about the install .
upon leaving he left all the boxes and packing materials in the kitchen .
big avoid !
ii would not recommend this place for active or any military member currently serving .
first , i dropped off my dress blues uniform on a wednesday afternoon .
the employee working there stated the uniform would be ready the following thursday .
hearing this i left my uniform there .
i was pissed .
now the store is empty and i am the only customer both times .
obviously he is unhappy and does not pay attention to details .
for those of u that take your uniforms there you have been warned .
there was no help for them in any way .
they would rather lose a customer than make things right .
first of all you have to leave your purse at the counter .
i am not comfortable doing that anywhere .
the only place i have ever seen this before was asu 's bookstore .
then you walk in this warehouse that has no air conditioning !
no sorry .
so i am lost of what to say .
did not live up to the hype .
i do not let it out of my sight , ever .
the prices were maybe $ _num_ below retail stores at the most .
if you live _num_ minutes away , sure .
_num_ % of the stock was stuffed toys and dog clothing .
this place did n't want our business .
i wo n't go back .
i have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience .
no dice , he told me that i had to go .
this time _num_ cans were defective .
yes its my fault for not checking this prior to hitting confirm button !
cons : abysmal customer service .
terrible .
inventory control needs some help .
then you might be screwed .
is ridiculous !
it 's been _num_ days !
the repair service is terrible .
it broke off after them using to sheer _num_ lamb !
`` the repair man that fixed them did not do it right .
by taking too much of the outside covering off .
i will not be recommending this place to anyone ever .
first my shipping error , now this .
the owner of this company was a completely greedy business owner .
it 's sad because i thought they were a good , honest company .
do n't order from here , you might get screwed in the end .
i really hate giving bad reviews , but the seafood was terrible here .
cost was too expensive .
the salsa was just ok .
very disappointing .
ordered the fish n shrimp tacos and i was pretty disappointed !
not much flavor in the shrimp or fish .
the salsa did help but overall they were weak tacos .
i 'd rather stick to rubio 's for tacos .
i did n't order anything else so this rating is just based off tacos .
i called their _num_ number , got the call center in phoenix , az .
i knew i was wasting my time at this point .
they went back and made it as i stood there for about ten minutes .
nothing to make me want to return .
two stars for poor customer service .
it 's none of your business and quite rude .
this rainbow led to disappointment .
not very sweet which i imagine some people enjoy , but not me !
the not so sweet donuts with icing all tasted the same !
zero flavor !
sorry to tell ya my fellow yelpers !
unfortunately , the owner was rude and indifferent .
no hello , no how are you , no welcome .
how incredibly pathetic .
i just had the worst experience at red .
how can a store possibly survive if you are treated so poorly .
not here .
it felt more like an overpriced museum .
i 'll never waste my time there again .
never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit .
whatever .
i was so excited to check out this store .
when i received my bill it was for $ _num_ .
i am very upset that i was billed almost twice what they quoted me .
worst clinic i have every experienced .
they are too big and give patients false hope .
do n't rely on them scheduling you correctly .
very very disappointing .
this group is one of the worst i have seen .
everytime i would go they had someone new .
the following morning i had emergency surgery to save my son .
thankfully i am _num_ weeks post surgery and now _num_ weeks pregnant .
the chips and salsa were decent but nothing special .
the cabbage slaw accompaniment was of no help in adding flavor .
overall a very disappointing experience .
we complained to the waitress but nothing was done .
the service was not the best either .
current phoenix sales tax is _num_ % and we were being charged _num_ % .
they comped my food , which was n't necessary , but they insisted .
my taco and tostada were just alright .
the beans in the tostada were cold , which i am not used to .
we 've had everything better somewhere else , and feel no need to return .
what a disappointment !
first off , i thought the service was mediocre to poor .
no water , no extra chips for the table of four , nothing .
my wife tried the huevos rancheros , which were okay , not terrific .
i had the two enchiladas and shredded taco plate , about $ _num_ .
gut bomb was more like it .
my daughter had two shredded beef tacos for $ _num_ , filling .
i live downtown , so only about _num_ min from here .
i wo n't be back .
the meal was n't terrible , but easily forgettable .
nothing `` special '' at all about any of the items .
meat in all the dishes was tender but not very flavorful .
all in all , a disappointing lunch .
the breakfast burrito was particularly boring .
i think i could have made a better one myself .
stopped in here for lunch on our first day in phoenix .
ice cold corona 's at $ _num_ a pop .
the sign on the door says they close at _num_ pm .
this was extremely disappointing since we had driven from glendale to eat there .
wo n't be coming here again .
chips and salsa were n't anything special , kind of tasted bland .
the front office staff is so beyond unprofessional and incompetent it blows my mind .
the chairs did n't break when we sat on them .
, and what edible food there was was simply average .
this place always runs out of items on the menu .
it was bad enough she did n't check up on her guest often enough .
never smiles .
avoid the water .
but this one is always short staffed .
and there does n't seem to be much management around to smooth things out .
do n't know that i 'll venture in again for quite some time .
i was there for a late lunch ( 2:30 ) .
she was not providing service to other customers .
come on , people , fix up the place - okay ?
there was literally trash and food all over .
not one person asked us why we were leaving or anything .
we just walked out .
however , our biggest problem was the service .
she cleaned off a table and sat us .
some time had passed and we were all out of water with no service .
he gave me a dirty look and went into the back .
_num_ mins later our waitress comes back and finally asks if we need anything .
also , this terrible service was from the night shift staff .
never going back !
this is a _num_ star at best .
the prices is not $ should be $ $ .
i 've gone to better restaurants with a smaller bill and more food .
the food was around the mill nothing special and nothing terrible .
horrible horrible horrible service !
was n't even busy today !
no more .
the prescriptions are not filled when promised .
they lost one that took me forever to get .
horrible place .
tomato soup with basil , good flavour but to course in texture .
much too sugary with no other flavour .
burger was good , sandwich was very mediocre .
for the money and the food , we probably would n't go back .
around the same time we ordered a bottle of wine .
they were also very misleading with their sides and salads .
overall , a pretty uncomfortable and disappointing experience .
something is wrong here .
unfortunately , the food does n't make its marks .
the building itself is adorable .
maybe used to be an old house ?
from a very snobby waitress , i was immediately put off .
nothing was bad .
nothing was stellar .
for $ _num_ , i ca n't say i was thrilled .
very quiet , like empty quiet .
but we wo n't be back for dinner .
when i called , i thought i was lucky to have reached the owner .
i said , `` some are ; some are n't . ''
she said , `` i do n't think this is a place for you .
two thumbs down ; two thumbs way down .
food is where it goes downhill .
we got the crab cakes which were only mediocre .
the ones i make are better and they do n't cost $ _num_ .
my husband got the surf and turf and it was not good .
my excitement did not last long .
chefs can have an off day and food can turn , i get it .
just weird .
this place is all hype and nothing memorable .
burgers and hot dogs were not a or even b quality .
wait , nope .
hot dogs = terrible .
too thin and no flavor .
two attempts to get the food we ordered .
not a smooth running process .
but they keep getting the orders wrong !
shame !
if i could put zero stars on this review i would .
no french fries ?
carrot and raisin salad on the menu ?
really this place was gross .
they need to just scrub the place down .
the meat was tough , and could not be eaten .
how can you make a gross blt !
everything else sucked .
if you want to eat diner food without getting sick , go somewhere else .
and yes , i tried this place a couple times wanting to like it .
and no fries ?
dry , flavorless , terrible .
well , i had been warned and ca n't exactly complain .
problem _num_ : very dry chicken .
how hard is it to make a chicken sandwich taste good ?
musty is chic now ? )
_num_ in phoenix is like _num_ in boston .
the food on the other hand is horrible !
i got a ruben sandwich , it was pretty dull and flavorless .
i also got a side hawaiian salad , which was also flavorless .
burgers , hot dogs and cold sandwiches .
wrong ice cream , wrong topping .
but it took so long to get that i just ate it .
unfortunately i was very disappointed with the quality of the food .
it looked equally disgusting .
this was my third time and probably last .
the service was terrible .
no particular server assigned so therefore no one to check on us .
even though this is an ice cream shop i would n't take your kids .
i wo n't be back again .
the food is absolutely dreadful .
however , i thought i would give it a chance .
big mistake .
why _num_ star ?
it was dreadful .
they are not even trying to make it good .
can not comment on food as we only tried the shakes .
meaning the shake had no flavor .
but wo n't return for the food or shakes .
first impression : bad .
service : terrible .
the wait staff was young and in need of training .
then two mistakes still were made with the order including an incorrect entree served .
dude , just write it down !
as we walked in we were told to seat ourselves .
we just shrugged it off & ordered .
i was so embarrassed that i picked this place !
you 'd think with those prices the service would be much better .
i was severely disappointed .
the food was terrible and completely overpriced .
the service was not good .
the icecream was something you could buy at the grocery store .
do not waste your time here .
bought a groupon and used # _num_ of _num_ .
not sure i will go back to use the other _num_ .
the food was not good at all .
ordered a cheeseburger , potato salad another bacon cheeseburger and hawaiian coleslaw .
the cheeseburgers were frozen patties and cooked clean into next week .
waitress was not friendly either .
no french fries !
potato salad , chips , coleslaw , carrot raisin salad .
my pastrami and swiss on marble rye was pretty burnt and fairly bland .
the potato salad hardly had any flavor .
pretty dissatisfied with this place , will not be returning .
food was mediocre at best .
however , the hard boiled egg was food service .
no bacon , which almost always comes in a chef 's salad .
meats were the cheapest of the cheap .
the small print on the coupon stated after _num_ pm .
i missed the fine print , but the server did n't .
this is a very short window .
she also had a side of potato salad it was very bland .
probably wo n't be back unless we have a visitor that wants to go .
the problems i had was the food had little to no flavor .
we went twice and tried different things with the same level of disappointment .
the chicken sandwich was on the second visit was just as bad .
the potato salad they raved about was even more bland .
no french fries , just bags of chips .
the place really needs a good cleaning before i will go back again .
the only reason to check this place out is for its historic value .
if you decide to trying this place out ... have zero expectations .
stopped on on my lunch break which was during their rush .
after another _num_ minutes i asked the waitress if i should come another time .
sincerely disappointed .
the store its self is retro , but dirty retro .
this was disappointing .
i think overall , i will try another place before i came back here .
i had a great visit here .
i had a craving for ice cream so tried this .
great idea , but cleanliness is not a thing here at all !
i have no picture to add because the waitress did n't let us stay .
and the menu is n't online .
you hardly know it 's a restaurant because of all the antiques .
a little too dusty for my liking .
the food is what we went for but i was disappointed .
there are some sides offered like potato salad for example which was tasty .
i had the `` bird '' , which was a turkey burger .
first off it is a frozen tasteless pre-made patty .
i hate that taste .
nothing worse than freezer burnt meat .
do n't order the turkey burger because you will be disappointed .
very flat .
and it was definitely not worth the _num_ buck price tag !
we wo n't be going back .
ok , i 'm all for dive bars .
the pee smell was just too much .
i do n't get it , it was n't a very good burrito .
i have to say i was a bit disappointed .
shame on them for no chips and salsa !
the green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners .
worst mexican disaster to hit planet mid town .
sloppy burrito fold gooey cheese processed beans .
the restaurant has no place to sit indoors .
they have limited hours .
no way !
it 's slow , pricey , and the food is just average .
the menu is confusing and the cashier did n't really explain things well either .
i gave it _num_ stars for lack of process .
over rated !
very reasonably priced .
orders ... .
wrong !
chicken was dried out , and hard .
i went to ranch market !
i hate it that there is only one door to enter and exit .
they also only usually have one register open or _num_ max .
but there are several checkout lanes .
they sure do n't know how to do business .
broken dates of service always has a excuse .
broken dates of service always has a excuse .
no recognition from staff that this is an issue .
this is a _num_ minute job to do !
do n't use this location .
he did n't know left or right or north , south , east west .
`` oh , no problem .
do n't do business with this place !
no wonder the warranty was only for a year .
the room was ok , but the ac was absolutely scary .
the other thing i had problem with was their free wifi .
in my opinion , the facility is probably way too old .
i would not stay here again if i ever go back to phoenix .
i 'm paying $ _num_ a night on the weekdays .
worst hotel ever for this `` level . ''
we get to our room and the key does n't work .
the front desk gave us the wrong room key .
it actually opened another room .
gross overall .
underwhelming - attention to detail is lacking .
i did not have a good experience here .
the bathroom looked very worn , the shower and sink leaked .
very noisy .
i visit phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location .
the hotel is marginal , but needs some major updates .
the last _num_ mornings i arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs .
worst front desk staff ever .
sufficient .
the pool and hot tub have a very , very rough bottom .
the room was barely sufficient .
_num_ mushy queen beds , a couch and _num_ tvs .
not sure if this is new , but its cash only .
it was a friday night , maybe we 'll try again on a weekday .
at _num_ pm , we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices .
that 's not an attempt at humor .
we both got ceviche apps , which were pretty good .
not sure ) .
not return .
the mariachi band was so loud it actually hurt my ears .
i was excited to try this place based on all the positive reviews .
unfortunately , this is just bad seafood , not matter the type .
i ordered the seafood ceviche and it was not fresh at all .
i 'm not from here and was looking or some authentic mexican food .
service was slow .
margarita was weak .
the sea bass was gross .
the staff was super nice about it and the owner did n't charge me .
bad dream .
unfortunately , the food was only okay .
wo n't repeat as my disappointment will not go away any time soon .
im only giving _num_ star because i ca n't give _num_ stars .
way overpriced for the amount of seafood you get .
do n't think i 'll be going back to this spot .
they did n't taste fresh either .
i do n't get all these 4-5 star reviews .
the only thing good there was the waitress , who was attentive .
disappointed .
i will not be visiting this restaurant again any time soon .
good food but terrible waitresses .
it ruined my entire meal with the family .
the wait for the food was long as well .
the location is not very big and feels crowded inside .
there are no baby changing stations in the restroom .
the place is very small feels very crowded especially with the band .
terrible servers .
as soon as we got our food they brought out the bill .
watered down shrimp cocktail , and al pastor tacos that were really not flavorful .
horrible service .
i waited _num_ min before getting drinks even though there is couple of tables .
food very mediocre and service was very slow .
as for the food the chips and salsa were on point .
but the beans and rice were terrible .
do not buy a vehicle from these people .
i do not see how they have stayed in business for so many years .
again do not buy a car from them because you will be sorry .
horrible place to do business !
my girlfriend and i bought a car here in may .
`` if it is broke , just ignore it .
it 's not our problem when it leaves the lot '' .
dropped it at a local shop to see what is wrong .
over $ _num_ to get it fixed .
total rip off kind of people !
not trustworthy !
i ca n't imagine doing this to people every day .
ate two bites and moved on .
overall not a good experience .
he is so cold and the office is like a zoo .
the doctors are way too busy to provide any real patient care .
i came home , shut the alarm off and went back to work .
at this point about _num_ % of the work was done .
i would never try to deal with this company again .
he told me he would call me back in _num_ minutes with the info .
do not get a car loan from this company .
my husband is a disabled veteran and they do n't care .
worst customer service ever !
sorry to be harsh but now i really appreciate the botanical gardens in california .
i agree with ian below as well .
it 's too bad .
but for me it was too much so .
poor customer service .
there were signs at the entry pointing wedding guests where they should go .
garden scheduled to work until _num_ pm .
they should let people know before selling tickets to them .
i just do n't get it .
the hype around this place is ridiculous .
what the desert botanical garden has is desert .
the desert botanical garden is just desert .
and i 'll go for a hike .
i second the other reviewer that does n't `` get '' this park .
nope , i have n't missed anything .
second visit was as underwhelming .
what a complete waste of money .
unfortunately more than half the areas were closed due to private parties .
they should decide whether they are gardens or a wedding venue .
sooo not worth it !
if that 's the case i feel sorry for phoenix !
it happened to someone else in my group so it was n't just me .
unfortunately , you 're gon na have to wait for it .
service is slow , and not always friendly .
i 've been there many times , and this is the case every .
otherwise , i 'd rather give my money to people with manners .
walked in and everyone looked up at me and then looked right back down .
could n't get anyone to answer my questions or even acknowledge me .
seems the non jeweler has the place figured out .
and said how `` much more advanced '' she was than that .
anyway , i needed something specific so i tried to get past it .
their prices were not very good either and their service was terrible .
appalling service .
it 's the `` who can we blame game '' when something goes wrong .
if you wanted to be treated rudely , this is the place .
really , google the items you want & order them somewhere else .
they are rude , slow , and rush you out at closing .
unfortunately , i had my two kids with me .
i am not that kind of parent .
she was just rude .
because of their bad attitude and rudeness .
i walked out !
mario is an accommodating , polite , gentleman who appreciates your business .
i quickly paid and left .
i went into this store yesterday buying all supplies needed to make jewelry .
left a very bad taste in my mouth i will not be returning there .
the store itself is filthy .
this is completely unacceptable .
my suggestion to everyone ; avoid the store until they get their act together .
this is not a cool place ... and the booking is god awful .
in fact , i do n't think i 've ever seen anyone in there .
it 's usually empty when i drive by or stop in .
there is n't much room to move , and it 's poorly lit .
the bar was shut down , and my $ _num_ cover went to waste .
i likely wo n't be back .
agree with the other two in regards to this subway .
not here .
i had the tuna today and it was gross .
very disappointing .
two words .
they leave ash trays everywhere for anyone to smoke .
it was disgusting !
when i went to complain the woman at the front desk did not care .
she then gave me a look with attitude and i walked out .
the in room dining is mediocre at best .
i 'm glad i 'm only here two nights .
the only good thing about this place was the cookie when i checked in .
it was all downhill from there .
it 's not .
that 's ridiculous !
i can not recommend this hotel .
the hotel and warn and very out dated .
the carpet in the guest rooms is disgusting .
it 's just too much trouble i guess ?
the place feels like an old run down days inn .
there are two positives .
a little disappointed in this hilton property .
not the best hilton property i stayed at .
find another hilton in phoenix if you can .
needs a major remodel and cleaning job !
come on , hilton , get your act together !
the lady at the desk is like _num_ years old .
my family and i checked into the room just fine .
once we got up to the room , i gave the kids a bath .
the water did not heat up well and was more on the cold side .
when i went to take a shower the water was not hot .
i should have asked for a discount off the price for the inconvenience .
i will not be staying with the hilton again .
i did not plan to get in as it was too cold .
unfortunately this room was dated , dirty and noisy !
popcorn ceiling , stains in tub and on curtains , carpet that looked dirty .
( there was a high school band staying at the hotel ) .
there 's no standards and no new construction .
it 's a crap shoot .
i would have much higher expectations for $ _num_ .
no a/c that works .
glad we left , never again !
it is by far the worst service i have ever received in this city .
it was too sour for my taste buds .
after _num_ or _num_ minutes , our appetizers came .
two thumbs down .
this should n't have been their best dish .
i could have cooked better fish .
my chicken was dry and the shrimp did n't have any flavor to them .
applebee 's fajitas was definitely better and that 's not saying much .
the total bill came out to $ _num_ which is n't bad .
we were disappointed with the food .
there was n't much flavor to the food .
that was some seriously dry , bland food .
the pupusas were crazy delicious though .
i would totally return for these .
one of my worst experience ever my eating pupusas .
my husband and i had lunch here on one of his day 's off .
obviously , i do n't see a return trip to this place .
they are down to the owners wife as the server .
they ordered after me about _num_ min .
there to go order was ready before my dine in order .
i figured i could find a place with better customer service .
why would u do that to your own business ?
horrible !
the lady has no manners and talks to you like your stupid .
nothing to brag about .
no thank you .
the doctor i met was n't that helpful & courteous .
never spent more than _num_ minutes with me in any of the visits .
he did n't give a clear enough idea about my condition .
wo n't recommend this place to anyone .
why is everyone standing around ?
but no one was really anxious to help me out .
i should have went elsewhere but my car needed it bad .
she 's the most dishonest employee ever .
too bad it ended there .
then my car was towed to a more trusted shop across town .
this is a good place to waste your time looking for customer service .
do n't waste your hard earned money , too .
i had my car serviced here .
after all , they 're yelp reviews are nothing but raving fans .
a trusted , hard working , friendly auto business .
no problem , i tell them .
would you guess i received no response ?
save yourself and do not bring your car to this pep boys service center !
so i believe him and they fix it too .
i went there for a tire patch on my rear left tire .
i was unsure if i could leave or not .
i walk to the employee area he went to and waited .
i paid $ _num_ for all of this .
this pep boys is either dishonest , incompetent , or both .
just terrible , trying to take advantage of people .
only in phoenix .
if this is how they make them now ... um ... alright .
pretzel dogs with bacon and cheese are suppose to have bacon bits .
goodbye forever , sonic .
the customer service at this sonic is horrible !
i know it 's sonic , but c'mon .
it 's called low lights people .
if she was guilty she would be in prison right now .
what i mean is - this is _num_ - the age of technology .
guess i 'll watch fox from now on .
the _num_ guys sounded like they did n't know what they were talking about .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
bad form !
this abc station is very unprofessional .
i ca n't believe these people .
bad form !
bad .
terrible service .
these guys are idiots and have poor customer service ethic .
worst customer service ever .
customer service is because you want to not because you have to .
the main problem is the walls are very thin .
i can hear conversations from my downstairs neighbors like i was in their apartment .
this place is an absolute nightmare .
they , however promised to find me another location .
huge mistake .
on my tour through the unit it was a disaster .
every time i complained i was promised action that never seemed to come .
i reported this to no reaction from management as well .
this property has become and absolute disaster .
i have been paying online the entire two years and it 's been fine .
hate !
if i could give negative stars i would .
the laundry room is always in deplorable conditions .
they are not helpful at all .
waste of time !
there is another autozone location on 40th st. and thomas which is far better .
i guess i forgot to mention street noise on this reservation .
this hotel does not allow you to control heat vs. air conditioning .
when they are below _num_ , they turn on the heat .
when they are in between , everything is shut off .
i wo n't be back .
one of the times , they went right past me at the meeting point .
but i wish i stayed at the double tree .
however the service was lacking quite a bit .
with the amount of money we were paying , it should have been perfect .
not , even your normal cockroaches but , gigantic cockroaches .
this restaurant probably has to be the most overrated india eatery in arizona !
went with my family for a weekend lunch buffet and was thoroughly disappointed .
the food was stale and the service was really bad .
have to agree with elizabeth l. about getting some good indian food in phoenix !
they did n't seem very friendly .
i just did n't care for how slow they were .
very bad food and very bad service .
all in all very bad food .
in my opinion , indian food is not a cheap venture .
what happened next is not something i will forget soon .
this time was different , i could not let it go .
i do not really see myself going back here , but who knows .
the quantity was so little for the price and it was really salty .
i still would not be ordering from this place again .
the curry was ok and the tikka masala , well ive had better .
`` is this what i paid $ _num_ for ? ''
`` why did i pay $ _num_ for this ? ''
not lamb ? ''
`` should i finish this or no ?
terrible .
terrible .
terrible .
i visited this restaurant with a phoenix dining card and never got my discount .
a complete waste of money and ruined my day .
the waitstaff is not attentive or helpful in the slightest !
for the price , i would expect better service .
we used to love this place , but the food has gone way downhill .
i took some friends to try indian food for the first time .
the service was not good at all .
sadly i do not and would not recommend this place to anyone .
no apologies .
you 've been warned .
i went to this place on my trip to arizona and phoenix .
just awful .
they do n't care about their customers .
went in at _num_ pm on a sunday .
restaurant had perhaps _num_ tables sat .
waited over _num_ minutes for someone to take our order .
waited another _num_ minutes and left .
second , the _num_ % was added on for the lunch buffet .
the decor was nice but the food , not so such .
i basically just at the chicken marsala and rice , which i enjoyed .
everything else just looked unappetizing due to the presentation .
maybe they do a better job for dinner , i do n't know .
they put green and red bell peppers in the indian food !
i could n't believe it .
it 's not worth the $ _num_ bill .
they served beer that was expired by _num_ months .
they seem to stock old beer .
mediocre food .
i came late afternoon that maybe the reason for the bad service .
the chicken curry was really salty and reheated from that day 's lunch buffet .
the lamb tasted so bad that i ended up not eating it .
seems like they have too much business and are way too busy .
i guess you dont need my business .
if you are indian you will regret it .
it was yellow rice with some boiled chicken some sliced jalapeo and tomato slice .
unfortunately , we were let down .
being that this was a specialty you would think it would be pretty good .
unfortunately more than half of the chunks of `` meat '' were bone .
yes , tough chicken .
the garlic naan was a a little too burnt too .
if there was a no star option , i would have chosen that .
cold , stale food .
bad service .
never ever going back .
maybe i 'm just partial but i did n't enjoy the flavored .
i had a bad day - do n't judge !
do n't be lazy staff - dump and start again .
this place is a homeless shelter .
it 's nasty in there .
after i insisted , they sent someone to pick it up .
this last time was horrible though , really poor & unprofessional customer service .
sorry for my long review .
if i could give this zero stars i would .
trust me , this place is n't worth the cost savings because of her .
not a huge selection of books .
do n't park your car here while traveling .
hotel staff and bus driver said this has happened numerous times .
$ _num_ later , car is fixed .
situation was handled very poorly by hampton inn management .
maybe i stayed here at a bad time .
dingy , dirty , depressing .
holes in wallpaper , stains on carpet and furniture .
not sure if i can even sleep here .
it 's the many room problems which bring my ratings down .
thankfully , none of my stuff was missing .
and the lighting in the bathroom was also badly in need of an upgrade .
what a terrible visit !
the bathroom was a scene out of a horror film .
the sink and bathtub were something you could n't even imagine !
however she did n't even put in my rewards number upon arrival .
after entering my room i went straight to the bed and sat down .
then i walked into the bathroom .
she took down my number so the manager would call me .
that is why i 'm writing this review .
sketchy .
but , c'mon , it 's not that scary .
granted , i ai n't going by myself .
they serve drinks just like anywhere else .
there were lots of blue collar workers just getting off work and relaxing .
the drinks were cheap , darts were fun .
dive bar hell yes , a good one i think not .
the guys shooting pool were no joke either !
i didnt try the food but if i ever go back i surely will .
pool and darts and beer no extras .
i guess i am the only one who is not impressed .
not much has changed .
not that it is a bad thing to remain the same .
the two women who greeted and served us were fine i guess .
but the crust was like shoe leather .
overall probably would n't come back .
the food was awful .
who serves potato skins without sour cream ) .
these three items and one pepsi cost us _num_ dollars before tip .
we will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings .
the food ... is uninspired and bland .
the bread is commercial ( not made in-house ) but pretty tasty .
the red sauce is ... pretty bad .
the veal parmigiana was horrid .
the spaghetti side was forgettable .
i was not impress with the food at all .
we had a half pepperoni , half veggie .
i will never know , because god willing , i will never go back .
finally someone came from the back to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant .
in any case , it was an unprofessional way to deal with the situation .
lame .
i 'm not going back .
decent price , very large portions , weak on flavor .
zero atmosphere .
the salad is standard bagged mix greens and bottled dressing .
the pizza - decent crust , but totally lacking flavor .
chicken parm was crisp and moist but again had no flavor .
the red sauce was also just plain and the side of pasta was overcooked .
there were four of us really early ... the restaurant was pretty much empty .
anyway , they bring out our desserts first !
we ate our desserts and were still waiting for our food !
we went in for a quick bite and it took _num_ hours !
our server however was very poor .
food was mediocre at best .
just really not what i have come to expect .
if you 're looking for true italian food look elsewhere .
nothing bad per se , but nothing good either .
sadly , every time i go the experience is worse and worse .
it 's too bad .
i have no idea what happened , but it 's not good .
i would recommend the food just get it to go .
my granddaughter had the cheese ravioli and the marinara sauce was inedible .
my dog would n't even eat it , it went in the trash .
it was _num_ minutes .
waiting was in the bar with super loud , rude , obnoxious people .
after _num_ minutes , the hostess sat another group who came in after us .
did i mention i was with my mother and _num_ month old baby ?
we put in orders for waters and _num_ beers .
my wife ordered some fried mushrooms and zucchini .
below average to pretty bad .
we got a standard pizza , and it was bad .
soggy in the middle , too dry on the crust .
the sauce was mediocre and the sausage was pretty gross .
it was just a bad overall experience .
it was busy n we waited _num_ minutes roughly .
finally our food came out n the manager gave us _num_ % off .
the pizza was too salty but the wings were delicious .
nothing special ... i would skip it .
she made me sign another lease for my last month and that was that .
if there was a zero star option i would choose that instead .
such a shame !
new management is clueless !
this place sucks .
it sucked so bad , i would never go back .
if anyone told you otherwise , they were lying .
_num_ the bathroom situation is chaos .
the seating is extremely close from one another and the rows are crowded .
none of which sadly , would ever come true .
these girls played for almost an hour ... it was horrible !
i will not be back !
not to mention it 's clearly marked no cameras .
nothing besides tell us to stop `` making trouble '' .
this venue is awful .
i will never return here ; horrible overpriced joke of a venue .
third row is not so bad .
however , the place is old and is in desperate need of a renovation .
it 's a little inconvenient .
we went with a group of people to watch some fights .
i sadly do have complaints about it though .
place was filled with smoke .
obviously terribly managed !
obviously , the facility expected us to buy drinks while we waited .
overall , i 'd avoid this place .
not good customer service !
awful .
for starters , the concert did not start until 8:00 pm .
more women then restrooms and dirty .
reason for _num_ stars ?
my back was sore after _num_ minutes .
... not a good first impression .
also the concession stands are so loud it 's hard to hear the act .
horrible .
the entire two hours was miserable .
however , it needs some serious attention .
the bathrooms and concession stands are thoroughly outdated .
the only reason for the one star was the girlfriends i went with .
i honestly have to say this place is a mess .
my seat was very lumpy .
the place was very dirty .
ridiculous .
some of the worst seating i have ever been in .
hot as hell too .
too small and hot .
do n't recommend going here and i will never go back again !
the venue was a disappointment .
the lack of restrooms was a big deal breaker for me .
so no beer or drinks for me .
my daughter said there were only _num_ stalls in the women 's restroom .
disappointed but i knew that could happen .
over all glad i went because it was heart .
do n't think i would go to this venue again however .
not as good as it used to be , unfortunately !
and they raised the parking to $ _num_ , which is ridiculous .
the seating rows were not marked at all .
parking was $ _num_ coming in .
people were taking up _num_ parking spaces .
we could n't really stand to dance .
that bathroom is small , old and ridiculous .
my biggest problem with the place though is the atmosphere .
it feels more like a big bar than a concert hall .
with your friends and have a party , this might be for you .
no water fountains inside .
ca n't bring water in or even empty water bottles .
just trying to not pass out during my two hours here , you know ?
i would n't go there again .
absolute worst customer service ever .
i asked for a full refund and will take my business elsewhere .
you get what you pay for and this place has zero customer service .
i 'm not sure where i should start .
maybe the fact that it took them three weeks to get artwork to me .
had a horrible experience with this company a few months ago .
my story sounds very similar to the ones posted on here already .
got quoted $ _num_ for each side so $ _num_ total .
they did for free thankfully , did not expect that from apple .
lesson learned , just awful .
you 've been warned .
why was n't this mentioned when i placed the order _num_ days ago ?
really did not like it here at all .
food was not particularly great either .
i will not visit this place again .
it should never take _num_ minutes to get an under toasted english muffin .
wo n't be running back any time soon .
2nd time there , and still such very disappointing place .
it was way to hot , and it was microwaved !
i would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone .
maintenance is a second thought , with little to no urgency .
on top of that , they did n't care enough to find the mail !
less than _num_ minutes from almost every part of the valley .
unfortunately , those are the only two benefits that courtney village offers .
sorry , no dice .
sadly all these things have gone .
they used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate .
nothing ever happens .
they do n't take care about the current and long term residents .
it ca n't come fast enough .
not to mention they 're overpriced .
the staff is very rude .
the gate is constantly broken and there is no security here .
please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here .
i ca n't wait until this lease is up .
courtney village fails .
plus one was destroyed over a year ago and yet to be replaced .
parking is an absolute nightmare and the management will do nothing about it .
there were tons of water bugs that would come up daily in the pipes .
parking , is a nightmare .
the area is a complete nightmare , do not live here .
unfortunately , my good luck has worn off .
the new residents do not care about their surroundings .
they did bomb the building which helped for about _num_ days .
the gates are always broken , along with the spa .
also they started a trash service and they suck !
there 's constantly trash left behind everywhere .
bad really bad start .
upon our return the following week , my girlfriend 's car was stolen .
horrible place !
this was the same story and situation the past _num_ times we stayed here .
slept ok , the bed was fine .
no more again .
i do n't care about the price at this point .
this motel is terrible .
i wo n't be back .
they advertise `` you do n't need no teeth to eat our meat . ''
the last few times , it 's just been kind of `` meh '' .
the meat tastes alright , but nothing special .
unfortunately , it 's not just $ _num_ .
more than that , it was simply not good .
ten years ago this was the bomb !
there are probably _num_ spots and most of them fill up pretty quickly .
the bbq sandwiches at honey bear 's never seem to impress me though .
their is no picking your sandwich up and eating it .
if you try , it is just a mess .
as for food presentation , honey bear 's does n't do so well .
out of forks , out of salad ?
waited _num_ min for cold food ?
i ordered the chicken bbq sandwich ... was not that great .
the chicken meat lacked any flavor .
and the bread of the sandwich was extremely mushy .
plus , no sides and no kid options !
second time i went , same thing , but i got food poisoning !
a busy , well known place like that should n't have that happen .
i 'm never eating there again .
the food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down .
i 'm confused .
but honey bears has a _num_ star rating .
that 's why i 'm confused .
not sure if it was a bad day or what is going on .
my family was not to impressed either .
hot links were very average .
terrible texture .
honestly , i 've made better bbq at home .
pork was dry .
horrible horrible horrible catfish taste like crunchy cardboard .
wow , we were not just disappointed , we were disgusted .
not too impressed .
the baked beans were way too sweet as is the bbq sauce .
so-so cole slaw and dry meat .
after placing a huge order they said it would be done in _num_ minutes .
after finally getting my food i really was n't impressed .
coleslaw was only tolerable , to soupy and peppery .
the food was lousy .
the ribs tasted like the cow had mad cow disease .
the sauce was weak .
but the ribs were horrible .
this place really needs an overhaul .
it really did not feel clean to me at all .
place was empty , but trash cans were overflowing and dirty .
the tables were not wiped off and there was meat on the floor .
mediocre at best !
you do n't know barbeque that 's for sure .
something is up at the tempe honey bears , and it 's not good .
this was a huge disappointment !
horrible experience .
very disappointed .
new ownership maybe but it 's not the same here .
cashier was n't friendly .
food is just okay , but it is to expensive for what you get .
not real impressed .
sauce was n't all that and sliced beef was tough .
trash can was full , restaurant was n't real clean .
two small sandwiches and two sides came to $ _num_ .
wo n't be back .
did they change owners ?
lunch at honey bears bbq today .
decent flavor but for $ _num_ , i should get more than 2-3 oz .
what a disappointment .
the food was n't very tasty .
the bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back .
highly disappointed .
having not heard of it , i was in for it .
the aroma went from pecan wood chips to backed up sewage .
as expected from the response , it was mediocre .
never again ... never ... again .
went in today with my friend .
i 'm done with this place and not visiting this again .
i purchased a groupon coupon which had no expiration date .
as a consumer i feel they did not honor their agreement .
the food is very dry and the place is super dirty .
would not recommend .
i do n't believe the food was bad _num_ years ago .
to start the mac and cheese was so off base .
cold .
the collard greens lacked flavor and they were cold .
and the bun was just sad .
the young guy taking our order seemed completely confused .
he 's got ta be losing tons of money from this fool !
i felt very unwelcome here so i will not be back .
if you 're looking for good bbq , go elsewhere .
i 'm not sure what came out .
i was given a half pound of mush , absolutely drenched in bbq sauce .
it was like when you leave shredded wheat in the milk too long .
when i got my plate , it looked like leftovers from _num_ weeks prior !
went straight to the trash along with my $ _num_ .
the guy just did n't care .
there was no ice for the iced tea or soda .
the chicken was disgusting .
it was dry , the outside was hard .
i was really not impressed with the bbq here .
i nor my son wanted to eat it .
the ribs were inconsistent .
some were tasty and moist ; others extremely dry and chewy .
none of them were fall off the bone good .
my mac and cheese was just ... not right .
over priced food , served without a plate , in a real dump .
i would not recommend not the honey bears i remember , counter service sucks .
beer was cheap and cold at _num_ for a bud lite .
the corn on the cobb was hot but old .
beans were good , as was the mac and cheese .
we also had coleslaw and mac & cheese , which was overly salty .
i would get potato salad instead of mac & cheese if we return there .
brought the fam in today what a complete disappointment ... ... .
i asked why and the asian lady said the grill was n't on yet .
by the looks of it only the reviewers care .
how many ways can you spell disappointed !
i got the bbq chicken and my guest got the bbq pulled pork .
total cost : $ _num_ which btw was a great year .
the chicken did not taste fresh .
presentation was horrible !
the bun should have at least been toasted .
i was extremely embarrassed as my friend threw more than half of it away .
i am jeff and i call em as i see em !
very gross !
everyone one said there was no way they would eat that food !
so giving a _num_ , but i would like to make it a _num_ .
i guess it was a zoo of rocks n sticks .
yes , that must be it .
humans do n't put toilets in the kitchen , after all .
but , let 's face it , he 's not .
do n't tell me you have n't noticed .
how gross ! ''
maybe i missed it .
so ridiculous and quite the scam to keep our $ _num_ .
it seriously ruined our trip .
i 've never seen anything like that before .
i was fairly disappointed with this zoo .
it 's way too hot .
what a horrible idea !
what a waste of time !
if you 're looking for enjoyment , do not bother .
skip this next portion if you 're married with kids .
the worst thing about this zoo is the price .
a small salad costs $ _num_ .
a bottle of water is $ _num_ .
yes , i 'm complaining about the cost of two adults .
she must have needed a depends change and that would explain her crappy attitude .
this is primarily a hot weather zoo .
a lot of cages are empty and you get disappointed .
the animal selection was pathetic .
i do not recommend going during the afternoon on a hot day .
$ _num_ for a bottle of soda !
$ _num_ for a hot dog !
well now it is up to $ _num_ and still way overpriced .
did n't see much !
i would have given it a zero if it was an option .
take your money elsewhere .
it was ok , but just ok .
zoo itself is in a mediocre state of repair .
a frozen lemonade was almost $ _num_ !
hey _num_ tickets is a lot to paid & nothing to see .
there are some places you have to pay additional money for the rides .
will not return , one time is enough .
very poorly planned if you have kids under _num_ who want to walk .
i would suggest heading west to the wildlife world zoo .
for adults , not much to see and the zoo itself is small .
not worth it .
the animals are old , often hiding behind something .
it is highly over priced .
food was not the best .
a regular ticket does n't include much except walking around .
who was working the front gate called me a dick .
you are not gon na believe this , i 'm still in shock .
worst interaction with any employee ever .
( at this point i was n't mad , just wanted to leave ) .
he totally denied everything after that and did n't admit anything !
they did tell us one was closed but failed to mention the other _num_ .
even the seasonal ( yes , summer items ) were closed .
just way to high and not nearly enough bang for the buck .
poorly done .
the price point was ridiculous as well .
and the people at the zoo missed some opportunities .
she was not even remotely apologetic or sympathetic towards us .
i complained to the phoenix zoo and never heard back .
disappointment !
some animals were out but most were not .
do n't get the chicken sandwich its gross !
big deal when it 's _num_ degrees out .
also with many of the exhibits closed it was a bit pricey .
horrible class field trip , do not do the night camp !
we had a cold hard breakfast , and restroom use was hardly allowed .
poor quality , it seems run down and not very welcoming .
would not recommend !
_num_ stars might be two too many .
just relocated to phoenix so we thought we would try out the zoo .
do n't waste your time .
general adult admission $ _num_ .
the animals look hot and tired .
we spent _num_ 1/2 hrs walking around and never really got excited .
basically , the letter that was sent to us was bs bs bs !
very _num_ .
$ _num_ to the airport via taxi .
not so much here .
could have saved me time but just telling me that in the first place .
whole city block is out of water .
i 'm a gold member so i had access to the concierge level .
i hate to write a bad review of a marriott property .
probably one of the most frustrating things is their concierge lounge .
not very marriott if you ask me .
not impressed with this locale .
there was a dirty shirt next to my room door upon arriving .
i have never experienced such disappointment in my life at my fave hotel chain .
do not put a client in a wet carpet room .
this was a lie as there were no cops on site .
there was nothing she could do because they were paying guests .
this is not a corporate marriott !
rude staff and the worst service i have ever received from a marriott .
dont waste your money here !
hotel is marginal .
uninspired cuisine .
i was so confused what was happening .
not a vacation destination .
on the upside , it is very close to the airport and the _num_ .
needs updating badly !
wont stay here again until it gets a much needed remodeling .
car was broken into .
i 'm out over $ _num_ .
trash was still in the trash bins .
strange locked closet in my room .
absolute bs - your _num_ miles from the airport .
the end of my time at this hotel is over , checking out tomorrow .
absolute joke of a hotel with completely ignorant staff .
avoid this place at all costs .
my huge complaint and the reason for a _num_ star .
_num_ . )
she said no `` complementary for guest '' but , tip is not included .
i get in around 10pm and i did exactly what the clerk told me .
now , this is my first time here at phoenix airport .
they told me it 's about _num_ minutes from here .
walk down this long hallway and i 'll be at my destination .
and i had no clue just thought it was the standard pick up area .
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
_num_ . )
um burrito or taco ?
bad call .
first of all , i had to repeat my order three times .
not a tough one , and no special order .
however , he said they can give me an iced vanilla coffee instead .
no way , jose .
if i did n't have a coupon , i would n't have gone .
i 'll be throwing the other coupons in the trash .
just not worth the aggravation .
did n't give me a straw .
did n't put the lime in the fish tacos .
no lemon in my ice tea .
like taco bell , but not as fancy .
the friday night bartender was great but she quit !
good morning , is that the overwhelming smell of dog piss i 'm smelling ?
there is no hot water .
roaches are still present anywhere there is a drain .
nothing new here .
garbage stays on the grounds for days .
the water goes off without warning .
the plug for my bedroom lamp turns on by itself .
the sidewalk and stairs too .
the buildings are old and the upstairs heat up something awful .
dishes pulled from the cabinets often had bug crap on them .
the grounds are very poorly kept in places beyond the front office area .
the water in the apartments get turned off randomly without any warning .
your neighbors will break the rules in the lease agreement at every turn .
this past year has been pretty rough and i 'm disappointed .
since then , they moved it but not the same stall .
i 'm confused why it is n't allowed now .
you 're not allowed shade ?
i 'm not as happy here as i once was .
not a good year at all .
the gate seems to be always broken .
i see homeless people going through trash bins at all times of the day .
two tires has been stolen .
i no longer feel safe living here .
absolute worst apartments ever !
it just so happens that the office 's phone lines are down .
i do n't believe that happened , and i still have roaches .
there are gates , but no good if they do n't work .
`` no code or key required ! ''
same complaints by different people .
ca n't wait to put the roach motel in my rear view mirror .
do n't make the mistake that i did .
not impressed at all .
there are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on .
if i could leave a half star i would .
it 's a charming place to sit , but a disappointing place to eat .
there 's better mexican food in phoenix , go find it .
then she tells me they ran out of tamales .
there were barley enough rice and beans to cover the plate .
went here at _num_ at night and was already shaking in my heels .
they have a variety of stuff , but not a good selection of anything .
worst food city , i 've ever been to .
unorganized , no deli , no bakery , little staff , rude cashier .
worst apartments i have ever been in .
then on top of that there are alot of break ins in this location .
my window ended up getting broke one night by i dont know who .
i complained to manager but she told me it was nothing she could do .
this place is extremely noisy !
( maintenance did n't know i was in there ) .
they could n't have done it that fast .
the roaches never left .
but it was our $ _num_ .
the tenants that live there do n't care about other peoples property !
it will break again within a week , repeat process .
this place is horrible .
management does n't care , defensive and rude .
maintenance problems take forever to get fixed .
gates do n't close at night so anyone can come and go .
i would not recommend this place to anyone .
real pieces of garbage , not the complex but the staff .
i would not want any of my friends to be treated so poorly .
they do not have information cards at each fire truck .
do n't waste your money .
do n't go here if you have small children .
this is a museum for _num_ and up .
children _num_ and under are free .
adults pay _num_ dollars as of jun _num_ .
im _num_ feet and it was my on level with my neck .
the woman especially was quite mean to my seven year old .
my _num_ year old promptly apologized which was ignored by her .
her behavior was not appreciated and not appropriate .
i wo n't be going there again .
do n't let the outside appearance fool you !
needless to say ... do n't rent here .
also , and i ca n't stress this enough , read your lease thoroughly !
this complex is not interested in customer service .
it 's been one ridiculous thing after the other .
i am so sick of this place !
horrible horrible property management !
luckily we never had any major repairs .
do not rent here .
staff in the front office is horribly rude .
they do n't care about their residents at all .
before i gave them _num_ star because of the staff .
if i could give them zero stars i would easily .
my dryer has not worked since i moved in .
just do n't wait until you live here for months .
it only gets worse .
that is _num_ months when i signed a _num_ month lease .
awful awful awful place to live .
if i could give this _num_ stars i would .
their website for paying rent is terrible .
the problem with this place is the inept or non-existent customer service .
the washer stopped working and the dishwasher broke about _num_ months into living here !
i wish there was a no star rating !
they are old apartments and are falling apart !
this morning i had the unfortunate experience of having a flat tire .
he just drove away !
which is really unreasonable .
they took _num_ weeks to fix it and the patch job is a joke .
it looks like it might fall out of the ceiling any second .
the area around the complex is n't safe for going on walks .
it 's not safe any other direction .
i would n't pay more than _num_ a month to live here .
not worth it .
i would run _num_ minutes and it would just randomly shut off .
otherwise the customer service was terrible .
none of the screens fit properly .
appliances are terrible .
the maintenance manager asked what happened to my hand , i told him .
he signed the papers to hold a unit and put down a security deposit .
if i could rate in the negatives i would .
been two weeks and nothing has been done .
spend just over $ _num_ to get a coolant leak fixed .
he made me wait , taking phone call after phone call in another room .
so i 'll look elsewhere next time my car needs service .
this is not the place to go for dinner .
they have limited evening hours and it 's for a good reason .
i can put up with a lot of things for a cheap dinner .
i do n't need good customer service .
i do n't need to eat in a safe neighborhood .
i 'm not expecting gourmet , either .
sure , come for lunch .
wow , this place is awful .
it 's a lot more like _num_ .
terrible customer service .
they charged me twice by mistake and did n't get a refund for it .
just terrible overall , but what do you expect , it was $ _num_ .
but does n't mean they can charge me twice for their crappy motel room .
just pay an extra $ _num_ to go somewhere else .
its pretty obvious this is not the four seasons paris .
there is no fridge or ice maker .
and smoked brisket , oh yeah , smoked brisket .
good deal for _num_ bucks near an international airport , in a major city .
we did n't get our room key until the next morning .
our room did not contain a coffee maker or microwave .
the remote for the tv was broken .
the fire alarm is missing the battery .
the room was n't the cleanest .
the mattress is covered with dirty plastic .
if i could choose no stars i would .
there is nothing good about this property .
avoid if possible !
room was gross and walls were paper thin .
the environment was very sketchy and unsafe .
um ... check in time was 3pm ?
they would n't accommodate and said other hotels are worse .
um ... no .
this place needs to be shut down by the health department .
the worst room i have ever stepped foot into in my life .
and they will not refund your money after you see the room .
no , no , no and no !
it does n't even deserve a single star .
the room was flat out unclean .
i can not make this up .
i did n't even mention the kicker .
why are you charging people for rooms that are not even completed ?
i will say the vending machine has some ice cold beverages .
worst experience of my life .
hotel would not refund me my money .
honestly , that bad .
the tile was cut and uneven and somebody will cut their foot eventually .
i can not stress enough how bad this place is .
_num_ dollars would be too much .
the place is a `` no go '' !
_num_ light bulbs were missing in the bathroom .
the walls are even dirty , the tv is an old tube type .
my room did not have a working smoke alarm .
the water pressure was very good .
it is very close to sky harbor airport .
i was forced to give it _num_ star or you can not post .
worst hotel ever !
then we get our luggage and stuff is missing .
i ca n't believe the way they run there business .
this hotel is not safe !
this hotel is bad !
can i rate a zero ?
the manager did not seem to care and was very unprofessional .
do n't stay here though .
seriously no soap in the bathroom just a face towel ?
expedia what have you gotten me into ?
unfortunately not .
i purchased the full detail $ _num_ and hand wax $ _num_ .
i was very disappointed .
please avoid this place at all costs .
easily the worst car wash ever .
they take no pride in their work .
i have never had a worse wash in my life .
but he had no change so i had to give him _num_ $ .
wrong .
the clerk kept telling us that sunday through thursday was the more expensive price .
we get to the room , and it looked ok , at first glance .
it had a flat sheet that was a foot shorter than the mattress .
that meant they left a foot of exposed mattress where our feet touched .
_num_ plus tax .
it 's only _num_ for a king size smoking room .
i advise everyone to stay away from this hotel .
if i could have given it less than one star , i would have !
horrible place to stay .
dirty carpet , i do n't think it can be cleaned .
i was a little disappointed .
however i think they have the settings a little too high .
very poor conditions , both fairways & greens .
i would rate this as the worst course i have played in az .
also the green fee of $ _num_ is ridiculous .
i gave them _num_ stars because the course was in good shape .
the rest of the cultural center was empty and advertising for rent space .
what a disappointment , especially for the biggest holiday of the year !
sad because i hoped phoenix could do better .
not the best but not the worst chinese food .
soup was nothing special .
egg roll almost flavorless and mushy .
no ability to substitute lo mein for rice .
cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
flavoring is not consistent .
double serving .
counter service were really poor as you have to wait and look for them .
maybe because i went for lunch ... do n't know .
disappointing !
the hot braised shrimp had dry little baby shrimps with virtually no sauce .
the kung pao chicken had a slight odor to it .
i thought the flavor was okay but it was nothing special .
we dined at _num_ pm and the restaurant was empty .
the restaurant itself was fairly nice but nothing that stood out .
the menu was unimpressive .
it was the most generic chinese menu i 've seen .
this place claims to be an authentic shanghai restaurant but it was so americanized .
now as far as hot pot goes , it 's a failure .
the food itself was more like seafood soup .
may be i was expecting too much .
the food ... was passable but not amazing .
i 've had great chinese food but this was just okay .
so overall it was ok but certainly i would think twice before coming back .
the beef noodle soup was not tasty .
i will not be returning again .
ugh .
they told me _num_ minutes , and they were accurate .
i could n't eat any of it .
the soup ( hot and sour ) was way too sour .
the egg roll was just gross .
the fortune cookie was stale , and the fortune was even lame .
i would 've done better to get soaking wet and hit up panda express .
do not give the customer the bill before they are done eating .
do not use a mexican chef .
biggest mistake of the month .
the fried pork chops were way overcooked and dry .
at first glance , it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant .
in that particular dish , the beans should have been dried .
the pork chops were worse though .
and that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over .
i will not be returning .
lame .
not authentic .
but again , this is not new york ... .
ancient chinese secret my ass .
and she had the nerve to check my body for needles marks .
poor service in the pharmacy is common .
this is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business .
pharmacy is entirely too slow .
but these were christmas presents and i needed them tonight .
my mistake that i wo n't make again .
could n't possibly be more annoyed .
no hello .
terrible customer service , i wo n't be back .
i called my doctor and she was able to fix it in _num_ mins .
drive through has a _num_ minute wait and there was no line .
made reservations months in advance and no car was available .
a man at the hotel the first night had reservations too .
the decisions were made above her .
terrible service .
however , i will not be renting from this location again .
too much !
why would you give out a dirty car ?
windows were covered in a film that we cleaned off while filling the tank .
very difficult to see out while in reverse .
such a terrible customer service experience !
my mom was coming into town to visit and wanted to hire a car .
no big deal , we will just return it for another one .
our mistake was doing this on a weekend .
what a mistake .
this location wo n't let you rent here without a major credit card .
he said no , they would not under any circumstances take debit .
to make a long story short , beware of this rental company .
they obviously do n't clean inside or out of car .
i will never rent here again !
i talked to the manager and she just said sorry .
so bad !
i ca n't wait to move my accounts to my airline credit union .
terrible phone customer service !
was this woman clueless or just on a power trip ?
she gave the `` oh well '' attitude .
frustrating to say the least !
they did n't even bother to ask why or keep my business .
horrible place .
disappointing .
terrible meal !
never going back !
their prices are ridiculous for the portion sizes i was seeing .
she ( i 'm assuming she is the owner ) was beyond rude .
i walked out .
not only were they rude but their service is horrible .
incredibly disappointed in this place .
the chile relleno seemed as if it was stuffed a few days prior .
the rice was old and hard .
the beans served on all of our dishes were entirely inedible .
it was a red salsa and tasted like it was homemade .
i will never visit this place again .
i 'm here now and this place is beyond disgusting !
the server is so rude and the meat is covered in grease !
worse service ever !
no .
just ... no .
horrible .
_num_ cents each .
they were so bad , i could n't even force myself to finish them .
the asada was in big , tough pieces .
pastor was literally chunks of ground pork .
green chile beef was practically inedible .
i ca n't .
it 's not worth it , even for _num_ cent tacos !
anyhow , they said they did n't know how long the car would work .
my experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best .
we walk in the door , are seated , and handed the simple menu .
nothing of interest on the menu .
tried the kung pao shrimp and veg chow mien .
service was also not good .
not satisfied .
we figured , why not try a more traditional chinese place ?
the menu looked alright , like a typical small chinese restaurant .
i have to say , it was terrible .
lunch menu , pepper beef -- no better than _num_ stars .
wo n't go again .
everything else was mediocre at best .
i would n't recommend this place at all .
moral of the story : gross .
flavorless .
a gigantic waste of time and money .
we 're so disappointed .
i went to this restaurant with a group of seven other coworkers .
it was at lunchtime , so the place was a little busy .
however , we waited about _num_ minutes to be helped .
it was disgusting , i would n't recommend ordering it .
place was packed at lunch , maybe i ordered the wrong dish ?
man , we were really looking forward to this .
there were warning signs right away .
but lots of other stuff did bother me .
everything else was bland ... including the hot pot .
the waiter disappeared for about twenty minutes at a time .
just a bad customer service experience and average food .
i arrived for lunch at 11am and was seated immediately .
the atmosphere was ok , and the bar looked a bit disorganized .
i will not be returning to this place .
average to a little less than average .
staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check .
waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there .
however , their sauces were bland .
rice was a tad dry .
went in and was promptly seated .
apparently they did n't want to serve us .
we also had to wait a bit long for the food order .
rude yes , but nothing else got any kind of attention .
no excuse for a place with people at only _num_ % of the tables .
bad service , so so food and dishonest representation .
problem is , the coupon did not state that .
its called `` bait and switch '' draw them in with a false ad .
not the best but not the worst chinese food .
soup was nothing special .
egg roll almost flavorless and mushy .
no ability to substitute lo mein for rice .
cold salad next to hot entree next to hot rice .
maybe my experience would have been better ?
probably the food but i doubt the service .
check was delivered halfway through meal .
horrible experience .
it was water boiled spicy beef .
no offer to exchange it for something else .
bad customer service as far as i 'm concerned .
tip for the owners this is america , not china .
went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary .
terrible food and service to match .
went today for early sunday dinner and will not go back .
service was beyond horrible and food just ok at best .
also too expensive for what you get .
the worst experience ever .
will never return here .
no middle ground will be offered .
cantonese is sweeter with a semi thick sauce .
limited english staff .
about _num_ % of their patrons are actually chinese with limited english .
was n't expensive for the type of food served .
this was the worst food and the worst service i 've ever experienced !
the food came out exactly _num_ minutes after ordering .
was hard as a rock as they had over cooked what was already made .
would never step foot in that place again .
staff was rude , unfriendly and unprofessional .
the food was over priced and too salty .
when i called the lady answering barely understood what i was asking for .
i asked for lunch special and she sounded lost .
this was my first time at sp .
within _num_ minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out .
it really worries me when food comes out that fast .
all the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy .
horrible !
this is the main reason why i gave this place _num_ stars .
however , service was terrible .
each of our four person party 's entrees was delivered 5-10 minutes apart .
also , staff was rude .
do n't recommend .
the absolute worst restaurant experience in years .
pork ribs were broken bones deep fried with disgusting sweet sauce .
ordered what he recommended and it was disgusting .
yes disgusting .
dim sum came out _num_ min later with pink pork inside .
the owners should be ashamed .
overall the _num_ stars is due to the horrible service received .
walked in , host seating us without any greeting .
gross !
but i guess that is what sells ... .
so sad ... .
gross !
it was already after _num_ so i would have eaten anything .
well , i could n't eat the lunch i got from here .
i got _num_ bites in before i gave up .
even the egg roll was disgusting and i 'll eat anything fried .
named a sichuan palace but taste like panda express .
i could n't get through 1/4 of the cup .
chicken : the chicken pieces were tiny and the breading was way excessive .
i tasted very little chicken and the sauce was drenched in vinegar .
i had such a bad stomach ache afterwards .
way tasteless , pork was gross and mushy and just overall a poor dish .
save your money and time , avoid this place .
the dish was literally _num_ % peppers and _num_ % chicken .
i wo n't be ordering there again .
this place is the last place i would eat unless i 'm not paying .
this place is unprofessional and a complete joke .
i am not a patient .
the building does n't even open til 8am .
this is unacceptable !
this place is horrible .
paradise lost , one might say .
the airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not .
hotel is rather nasty .
it was all locked up ( more to follow on that ) .
curtains were ill fitting , going over the window a/c heater system and blowing .
below the heater though , that 's where the magic was found .
not gon na be staying here again .
you 've lost me on this one .
but no .
we got into the room , which was spacious and mostly clean .
just awful .
lesson learned , eh jay ?
a couple of things he missed though .
and i did n't turn it on to find out .
and there were some bright spots .
still , avoid this one like the plague .
do n't waste your time or money here .
after _num_ minutes , no food .
i have had worse , but not often .
the cook on duty tonight was simply incompetent .
this is probably a bad thing .
to call this mediocre is generous .
very disappointed !
ordered delivery , food was cold and bland .
worst general tso chicken ever tasted .
there was only one car in the parking lot .
i made a yelp account just to write a bad review about this place .
this place is just awful .
get in your _num_ degree car and drive down to jack in the box .
apparently they were short staffed so the `` waitress '' was doing a delivery .
i felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake .
money is too precious to waste on places like this .
this place is horrible do not ever i repeat ever !
this is true , i believe i saved around $ _num_ on the phone .
the complimentary case was cheap and i threw it in the trash .
the car charger will definitely be useful .
i also had to wait a few days to get my phone .
it was more than the _num_ day delivery that they advertise .
however this did n't bother me especially since i just saved some dough .
um , never had this problem at any other costco .
she is just a worker standing by the door like you .
i thought i was buying that from costco .
turns out i was n't .
i guess that 's fine for a regular car , but not for mine .
maybe i 'm doing it wrong .
so then why do i go here , you may ask .
diet coke , allergy meds and giant bags of frozen chicken breast .
why do i hate it so ... ?
they completely stop paying attention to what 's going on around them .
wan na know why ?
no thanks .
i 'll pay _num_ cents more per gallon somewhere else .
and for now , sadly , the answer is yes .
terrible experience signing up for membership .
lots of inappropriate comments .
we already hate it here and we just joined .
big mistake .
you only get one chance to make a good first impression .
terrible .
no flavor .
not impressed so wo n't be buying that again .
why is this so difficult to order a birthday cake from costco ?
seriously , this should n't be this difficult !
i left a voicemail requesting the refill by that afternoon .
why could n't she do that ?
he yelled at me as i left , but i ignored him and left .
they must not want me as a customer .
however ... ... lines have been really slow lately .
waited _num_ minutes to get through .
the one thing that kept me going back was their deals on tires .
i guess you could say i have been here _num_ times .
the first time was last summer and i just felt ill all over .
i was in the actual exam room for what seemed like _num_ hours .
finally they wrote me a prescription and i was on my way .
she was at a loss for words but then basically told me no .
there were _num_ people ahead of me !
i would give it zero stars if i could .
everything about this place is beyond awful .
in fact all of these clinics are terrible .
i try to avoid going to urgent care unless i am dying .
came back after two weeks because i still was sick .
although there was no line , i saw the doctor for approximately _num_ seconds .
i doubt my co pay and health insurance appreciated such a pathetic effort .
husband went about a year ago .
she is a navy veteran , served in war and everything .
this actually looks like some sort of bite !
should n't the doctor have done that ?
please , do not waste your time and money .
tried to call for _num_ days to set up a time to come in .
who is extremely rude and proceeds to tells i can either wait or leave .
i know i will never be back .
horrible experience !
horrible experience .
online system says check in to reserve your spot .
i arrive _num_ min later and they say check in does n't matter .
only one other patient was there , and one other showed up after us .
_num_ % agree with all the other _num_ star reviewers .
did n't seem to be in any kind of hurry to assist us .
sounds extremely inefficient and i doubt other urgent cares work that way .
i 'm sure it sucks working for a bad company .
so , again , avoid this place at all costs .
i ca n't eat much and bread is off the menu .
what i got was a charred hockey puck .
btw , i can not figure out why two reviews are filtered .
they seem on the up and up .
the food service is painfully slow .
drinks and food are n't that different from applebees down the street .
i would recomend going here just for the experience .
food is not the greatest but a heck of a deal for the specials .
not my cup of tea .
very poor service , very limited menu of deep fried and processed foods .
definitely a place to frequent if you `` want to be left alone '' .
i 've given this place multiple chances but every time i 'm disappointed .
i will not go back .
i should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat .
shame on me for assuming things .
the soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week .
the pizza was n't even pizza but crust with sauce on it .
not a sweet tomatoes that 's for sure .
watery mac n cheese .
the soup is not hot , like it should be .
service- nonexistent .
they take your money and off you go .
i do n't feel i got what i paid for .
it 's nothing special , but then again it 's a buffet .
the food just was n't that good .
the pizza , mac n cheese , and tacos were horrible .
it just tasted really cheap .
the ice cream ( or frozen yogurt ) machine was out of service .
ok , so i had the $ _num_ lunch .
tomatoes do not sweat .
had to ask for it , same with pizza .
however , i was definitely let down by this location .
maybe they just need more staff for a sunday after church lets out ?
secondly , they do n't clean the tables too often .
noon and i 'm starving !
be very careful .
however this location does not deserve your business .
i simply ordered a veggie and cheese .
... ... end result ... .
poor service .
get out of here guy you 're cheap and offer the worst customer service .
how funny the owners name is `` mike s '' !
at this point i was so over the experience entirely .
no customer service not clean and ca n't make a sandwich for shit .
pretty terrible experience here .
first off , this place is in a pretty bad part of town .
then when we placed our order , we waited another _num_ minutes .
they did n't even offer to comp the drinks lol .
she thinks cilantro is exotic and caesar salads are too spicy .
applebee 's is n't terrible .
not only is the food overpriced and barely edible , the service is horrible !
i doubt that we will revisit that establishment anytime soon .
the worst applebees in town .
it 's kinda my fault .
but most applebee 's i 've frequented have been decent .
but the food was n't up to par .
spinach & artichoke appetizer was so-so .
not much flavor .
my wife had the blackened chicken & penne pasta .
the chicken breast was overcooked and dry .
should have went to get burgers at five guys in the same parking lot .
do n't waste your time .
the server was over the top obnoxious .
he insisted on having our names just to take our order .
he was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive .
when i ordered my food he insisted that i order something different .
when i finally got my food it was mediocre at best .
the manager made me hate this place even more .
that was unacceptable to me !
i guess that does n't apply !
its probably another scam to bring customers in .
probably not going to this place anymore more for late night food .
do not eat here .
terrible .
i do n't like this location .
i drive further down the road just for the better service .
we have to flag him down .
i 'm so sorry to inconvenience you !
i order baby c some steamed broccoli and a juice .
j 's and my food come out as ordered .
baby c does n't seem to mind .
drinks ... he 's on the ball with refills of my water .
but misses the mark with j 's root beer refill .
he brings him dr. pepper instead .
wrong !
you literally could n't pay me to go here ever again .
however , things have changed and standards seem to be much lower .
in short , the service was slow and the food was disgusting .
was not impressed with my too oily & tasteless shrimp meal .
i walked out wishing i went to chili 's .
fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside .
service was quick , except for the replacement meal taking forever .
no idea of organization or time management .
the one manager is very condescending & could care less .
could be a major reason this applebee 's is going downhill .
they both have more responsible employees & managers that care .
to wait too long .
i will not be going back for some time .
this experience was very frustrating .
servers were rude .
i was reminded why i stop going , the menu sucks .
anyway what a waste of time and money .
i said , `` are u kidding me ?
why the hell ?
the music was so loud that the seating host could barely here my request .
not a chance .
it is n't surprising that this place is only _num_ stars .
this place is awful to order togo from !
never again will i order togo from this awful place !
he did n't return until _num_ minutes later to take our order .
but for now , do n't go .
this was the worst experience i 've ever had at a restaurant .
are food came _num_ minutes later .
only been to applebee 's a few times but never this location .
i wish i would have said something .
i have spend my whole day off from work sick as ever .
too slow .
do n't see any food coming out of kitchen .
so they are not too busy making food .
terrible service and terrible dry food i would n't recommend !
after waiting another _num_ mins , she finally picked up the check .
as she did it she snapped the book and walked away .
worst service i 've had ever !
they always play music way too loud .
i like to talk to the person or people i am dining with .
service is sloppy .
the carpet looked like the floor of a new york taxi .
they push drinks and deserts to the point of being obnoxious .
food is bad .
cold food and waited forever till anyone came to get our drink order .
worst experience .
he had _num_ beer prior .
there was so much gristle , you could n't chew through it .
i 'd have been my normal sarcastic self had my parents not been there .
they cooked the steak longer but you ca n't get away from gristle .
i guess the cooks like everything rare !
the food did not taste good at all .
i was very disappointed with the food .
the theme for the lunch was dry .
the mac and cheese was ... dry .
the chicken was ... dry .
the wings were ... dry .
i really love applebees so it is a disappointment to rate then this low .
sadly , the chips were the kind you bit from the store .
salsa was soo small there was no point .
had no bacon and it just looked a hot mess !
fries were small portion and soggy .
such a shame .
food is mediocre .
i sent an email to corporate , never heard back .
if i could give them zero stars i would .
the service sucked , took forever to even get a drink order in .
and my friends baked potato was rotten !
so nasty !
never again stepping foot in this place !
i have been in here numerous times and every time seems to get worse .
it 's pretty ridiculous .
i try to avoid this place as much as possible .
not good !
overcooked food , pre made drinks , and underwhelming service .
i hate you .
if i order extra cheese they forget it .
that 's me .
i called them after he returned and once again they were very rude .
i can be told no - just do n't celebrate it .
i am very disappointed with this landscaping business .
right now i 'm really disappointed .
only frozen meat , one type of sausage .
i walked out without buying anything .
walking into macayo 's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a vegas casino .
tacky , tacky , tacky .
i really like the mini chicken chimichangas .
greasy chips , tasteless watery salsa and horrible food !
i am not sure why people like this place .
but i have wasted enough money at their restaurants .
i came back here last weekend and i was so disappointed .
essentially , macayo 's is one of the staple eateries of phoenix .
it 's so sad to see macayo 's in the state .
the margs were watery and low on the alcohol .
never been to another macayos but not gon na try after that visit .
one word can describe this place gross !
the salsa was lame , the chips stale .
and the food at macayo 's is none of those .
the spanish rice was the worst i 've ever had .
the house salsa was ok but i 've had better from a jar .
macayo 's sucks and i 'm not afraid to say it .
bland red sauce , not crispy , and not served hot .
hubby said his fajitas were pretty good but my burro was gross .
the flan was ok & the chocolate chimis with ice cream were pretty good .
total with tip & free delivery was about $ _num_ .
a once phoenix staple has turned into complete and utter crap .
things have taken a big turn for the worse .
its hard to find anything under $ _num_ .
the food ( even the side of veggies ) was sooo greasy and fatty .
the baja sauce lost its kick .
the guac had no flavor .
i regret eating here .
-- salsa _num_ to _num_ days old .
shame on you !
-- refried beans go the same way .
did n't finish them ?
just throw in a bit of lard and put 'em back on the fire .
-- sopapillas for shame !
you could n't force feed me this shit !
highly disappointing after we tried it , and we crossed it off our list !
the salsa was crap and there was no chile verde .
the veggies are ice cold with tons of butter and barely cooked .
the chicken tasted like they been freezer burned and no seasoning .
the dish was n't appetizing at all .
just drop off the check and walk away .
i am on to your tricks ... no thanks ! )
please hire a waitress that has a brain and is n't slow !
worst mango and strawberry margaritas ever !
they got one order completely wrong .
now we have to wait another _num_ minutes for her food .
before we can open our mouth to remedy this he is gone .
i have never done that before .
cheese , refried beans , tomatoes , sour cream and guacamole .
the carpeting is tired .
it took our server _num_ minutes to come and get our drink order .
one member of our party ordered a coke and it was totally flat .
i had a chicken taco and the chicken tasted canned .
honestly , tasted like taco bell on a poor day .
i ordered a california burrito , for almost $ _num_ .
the tortilla was stale , and the flavor was just not there .
being from california , i 'm offended that they call this a california burrito !
not even a jar -- a can .
overpriced , stale fast-food .
i got the baja chicken quesadilla and it was fairly dry and bland .
there were hardly any people in the restaurant , what took so long ?
no wonder the taco was burnt .
but the black slimy stuff on the red pepper , what was that ?
also , no specials at happy hour time ( 4:30 on a weekday ) .
never waited very long , 1st steak fajitas seems fine .
additionally , our service was inattentive when it occurred and non-existent at other times .
if it 's my choice , i wo n't be back .
drinks are expensive .
service is awful .
the decor is just awful .
macayos is like chuck e. cheese without the games .
here , you just kind of bang your own head on the table .
noticed floors ( with ugly casino carpet ) were very dirty .
two parties that came in after us were seated next to dirty tables .
my meal was relatively flavorless .
the margaritas that were `` on sale '' were sugary and weak .
it 's sad to see this landmark on central in decline .
the bar : very disappointed .
music too loud .
too ethnic .
poor set up with entrance outside the restaurant .
the server left the menu 's on our table after we ordered .
i had the steak fajitas and my date had shrimp fajitas .
we had the margaritas that were on special and they were terrible .
the chimichanga was awful .
huge , but awful .
it was soggy and bland .
service was bad despite being the only people in the restaurant .
eh ... no .
the cheese crisp should be skipped .
there 's no flavor .
salsa tastes like it 's made from canned tomatoes .
chicken chimichanga was ok .
the place was relatively empty and too low of lighting to see anything .
there should n't even be an option for a star .
the service is horrible and bartenders are very rude .
i would n't recommend this place to anyone not even my worst enemy !
the chips tasted stale and the salsa was pretty gross too .
oh my gosh , they were even worse !
soggy , covered in sour cream and what i think was guacamole ?
i would n't recommend this place to anyone .
went to macayo 's on central last night for dinner .
huge mistake .
today i still have an after taste of grease .
this clearly does n't describe this place .
that would paint a picture like bob ross on this damn place .
do n't worry ... hunger is that last thing on my mind .
no , no , no , no .
the service was fine but the food was awful .
for the prices they charge , you have a right to expect better food .
this place has gone downhill .
i requested a table below a fan because they keep this place too warm .
that was a mistake .
after all this , my coworker gets a dirty soup spoon .
she requests another and ends up with another dirty one .
she requests another spoon - again - and my daughter requests one as well .
so disappointing to see what has happened here .
the chips were good but the salsa was very bland and watery .
the beef was ok but really did n't care for the cheese sauce .
the rest of my family said their food was just ok .
i really expected it to be better .
the margaritas which macayos calls `` the best in phoenix '' are not .
just do n't waste your money on them .
the food is decent but bland .
flat , old tasting soda .
burned cheese crisp .
i will never go to that location again !
never even addressed the terrible service we received !
my husband had the macayo tour meal and the portions were very small .
also the margaritas were very weak and tasted like water .
security was extremely lazy in getting management when i wanted to speak to him .
horrible graduation dinner .
i 've been to eat better places at lower prices .
the outside of the building drew me in but the inside needs an overhaul .
the place itself needs to be remodeled .
but inside is really outdated , restrooms are small and stingy looking .
a friend ordered something , i tried a bite and was not impressed .
definately wo n't go back unless dragged by friends like today .
we only saw our waiter perhaps _num_ times the entire evening .
there was nothing really negative one can say about the food .
like its out fault we did n't get service ?
so we get seated and still had to wait forever for chips and drinks .
i 'm never returning to this macayos !
not anymore !
once again , i end up with a terrible server .
this place has a serious staffing problem .
i just do n't understand why they ca n't get pleasant and qualified staff .
poor service , dirty restroom .
bland is a complement .
taco bell has more seasonings .
by far the worst mexican food i 've ever had .
not much flavor , runny beans , gross appearance and taste .
i wo n't go back .
wondering how it 's stayed in business for so long .
fish taco had _num_ % cabbage on it n barely any fish .
gave me _num_ % discount .
the single worst dinning experience .
forgot drinks and was rude .
there is a reason why it is empty on a sunday night .
was very very disappointed with this location .
the restaurant was not even half full or busy at all .
our booth was equally gross .
there was hair stuck up in it with food .
_num_ min later we finally got our bottled beers which were lukewarm .
no silverware and then when we got it i had food on my knife .
first time in my life i have n't left a tip .
not to the one on central .
i 've never seen such a filthy and unprofessional restaurant .
swing and miss !
there was n't a second bite .
she also waited at least _num_ minutes before he acknowledged her .
while the food is good , the service was horrible .
the service is just downright mean .
the tortilla soup was way over seasoned - could not eat it .
i have been here twice , year 's apart .
but this burrito was practically swimming with it .
i could n't eat more than half .
my wife got the chimichanga and it quite simply lacked any crunch .
but quite simply , there is no reason to revisit .
$ _num_ wasted and apparently they sent an upgrade !
also the flowers did not look like what i had ordered .
in the picture there are purple flowers which they just left out completely .
she said she would call me back and let me know .
i had a missed call from them later in the day but no voicemail .
i 'm sure i will have to call them back , again .
i do n't think i have ever experienced such crappy customer service .
moral of this story : do not use cactus flowers .
the absolute worse experience i have ever had ordering flowers !
it was awful .
attended the `` graduation '' night after being pressured into going .
just an old embassy suites type hotel at a higher rate .
reading the other reviews , i think their fault lies in their night staff .
bad choice .
he said that this hotel has been the worst in terms of service .
i 'd suggest a lower room , especially in the summer .
unfortunately our room key did n't work .
their shuttle would have taken us there , but they never mentioned it .
_num_ stars for them and _num_ for the night staff .
so disappointed .
no there was no one outside .
again no one there to help .
front desk customer service is horrible and the wifi connection is even worse .
very loud hotel .
i would not recommend this particular hotel .
the wifi is super slow at night .
the wifi at hilton was exactly the opposite .
the service here is horrific !
the pool also never had towels .
nope did n't happen , and they refused to change it .
they did n't even want to try and fix their mistake .
ugh where to begin ?
outdated decor everywhere .
i would give this place a negative _num_ rating .
was expecting a hilton quality hotel and this was not quite there .
it was advertised as near the airport but it was not .
it had no shuttle to the airport and the area was not that great .
i could smell them cooking bacon in the morning .
maybe someone that eats meat would appreciate this but to me ... yuk !
wo n't be coming back here unfortunately .
they 're getting _num_ stars only for customer service .
the first time , it was n't bad .
it was a little pricey , but the meals were prepared correctly .
the second time , however , was a totally different story .
the second sandwich was another veggie .
i called again and spoke to monica again .
no problem , i 'll just speak to your manager .
i threw it away .
delivery service is ridiculous .
the fries are usually lukewarm .
i received neither .
worst service ever .
i do n't know what all of the excitement is about for aj 's .
this place sucks .
the prices are just stupid .
i also do n't cook a lot .
all this hype for nothing .
this place has no natural foods .
i wasnt expecting whole foods , but really , whats the point ?
why not just go to fry 's or safeway ?
the same exact stuff you get at safeway for more $ .
_num_ corned beef steak remains .
about _num_ pounds .
-- nothing else .
_num_ stars for the awesome beer selection .
a turkey sandwich no mayo i say .
smh ... wont be back .
it was about $ _num_ for a turkey breast meal .
when we tried to heat it up , the heating instructions were no bueno .
the stuffing , gravy , and yams were pretty good .
the meal had three huge turkey breasts that did n't seem cooked very well .
aj 's fine foods did not deliver the quality that i was expecting .
their pastas and deserts are way too overpriced for the quality .
overcooked cold large prawns were so bad i had to return the item .
i , in error , went to the wrong place to check out .
sadly , i am not exaggerating this in anyway .
i was completely appalled by the lack of basic manners .
i am not sure if this was due to new employees or management .
they were both always rude , short , and unpleasant .
every time i said hello to one of the women she never responded .
the last straw for me happened last week .
i went to the deli area to get breakfast .
i greeted one of the deli workers and she again said nothing .
super disappointed with my treatment at the aj 's .
management obviously does n't follow up with complaints properly as well .
the crust was just so tough .
the store was practically dead the whole time i was wandering around .
you wo n't get more money from me aj 's !
avoid this store at all costs in the afternoon .
my friend gave me said flowers because i was having a rough pain day .
they are cheap money hungry people !
its overpriced junk .
they lie to get your money .
this place is dirty and you spend all your money here for lies .
not anymore .
go out of business already ... one bathroom in the whole store .
overpriced junk food .
it 's ridiculous .
basically ruined .
this is not the location to splurge on pricy cuts .
lame .
really bad experience today .
they never displayed the strawberries upon delivery and i feel cheated and frustrated .
aj 's fails at this nearly every time i go .
virtually every time i go there , i have an experience like that .
i 'll be avoiding going back .
one star is too many .
just a warning if you eat here and have allergies .
they hire idiots who lack important knowledge that could kill someone .
i stopped at aj 's twice this week for lunch .
no lettuce , no sprouts , no tomato , no cheese no mustard .
just an insane amount of meat between two slices of bread .
_num_ on the sandwich , total waste of money .
do n't forget to bring your attitude when you shop .
rude is what this place is .
never had customer service like this .
the deli people and the man serving the pizza were down right assholes .
keep your over priced crap and your fake ass employees !
also hoping they would take care of me somehow in this situation .
if anything the manager looked a little annoyed but gave me my money back .
all $ _num_ was n't even discounted .
the bacon was good but the scrambled eggs were terrible !
they were watery and barely edible .
they tasted like powdered eggs and water were mixed in with regular eggs .
i would not eat the scrambled eggs in any form .
yet again this saturday mid afternoon , service is bad .
_num_ people waiting for service at the bakery but only a single employee serving .
_num_ walked away and gave up .
lastly , guys that ringing noise you hear is a phone .
would n't last _num_ minutes in ny .
horrible !
meanwhile , she was standing at the counter playing on her iphone .
bread was stale , salad was n't fresh , pizza was just ok .
i could n't chew them so i sent them back .
when we got our new wings they looked a million times better .
they were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce .
my boyfriend ordered a philly i ordered raviolis .
she left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later .
who do you think you are charging that much for a horrible eating experience !
just not edible !
the pizza crust is rubber and just strange tasting !
the sauce is filled with sugar , and it was runny !
watery and not filled with goodness .
toppings were not fresh at all .
i love me some broasted chicken , so in i went to investigate .
streets of ny pizza was mediocre .
i was disappointed .
it was $ _num_ per topping .
my pizza was over $ _num_ .
the staff before him said i could only have one pizza .
um , wtf ?
they just lost my business .
not cool !
took another _num_ minutes for appetizers and first drink refills .
soggy , and no sauce .
... however sometimes you get what you pay for .
although the price was right , the pizza was not .
if i could i 'd give zero stars !
i ordered _num_ hours ago and the food just barely got here .
very disappointed and will never order again !
it was one of the worst dinning experiences we have ever had .
this is the second time i have had a problem at this store .
the first round of drinks was fine .
but we had to be rather obvious to get refills .
the antipasto was okay but not worth the cost .
the italian beef sandwich was awful .
the little bread appetizers was a plus .
i did not like the soup .
we stopped in last night after driving around trying to find a place .
pasta was cold cheese was n't even melted on top .
pizza was hard and yuck !
worst place ever .
ordered once and got really old chicken and fries .
plus half of the order was missing .
dont waste your money here .
their food is old and disgusting !
the wings were gross .
the sauce was weird and definitely not traditional hot wing sauce .
the wings were dry and overlooked .
ick food .
my suggesting here , is not to order the individual slices .
it wo n't happen .
in my case it did n't matter because my slices went into the trash .
just thought we would give it another try .
zero stars should really be an option .
after _num_ yrs i can not support this kind of company .
we left , with a hungry child and went elsewhere .
taste was just fair .
wings were cold .
customer service was horrible .
they said i had _num_ minute and they could not wait for me .
as i told them i did n't even need to come in .
they refused .
customer service is horrible here .
this was unacceptable .
it 's a sad thing when taco bell is better than something .
i do n't remember if he actually got his food first .
when we got our food , it was awful .
probably the worst mexican food i ever had .
i had a chicken burrito that was filled with bland rice and tasteless chicken .
mom had a ground turkey burrito and asked me where the turkey was .
why does n't del taco take a cue from pollo loco ?
i 've never had a bad meal at pollo loco .
this del taco even makes taco bell seem like four star dining !
the service at this location was terrible !
he was very curt with us and rushed through the transaction .
more like mediocre burrito !
no such luck .
it 's one thing to be too busy to take orders or help customers .
it 's another thing entirely to be so rude and unprofessional .
closed up lights off .
it 's fucking stupid !
and no one wants broken tacos !
stopped in for a few tacos and found out they were _num_ cents now !
remember when they were _num_ , _num_ cents ?
i receive them , and they 're skimpy like taco bell !
only a last resort .
this place just did n't do it for me .
waited _num_ minutes in a crowded room with weird people .
threw half of it away and was pissed because i paid so much .
i 'm not really sue why this place gets great reviews .
first there is no place to sit inside at all .
seating is not available at typical eating times and lines may be long .
there 's no option for fountain drinks or even local bottled water .
third , the service sucks .
fifth and finally , the bread is hard to eat .
there are no silverware to save you from the embarrassment of using your hands .
i have to copy stephanie b 's review below .
i do n't know stephanie b but what she said is dead on .
i could n't agree more .
first there is no place to sit inside at all .

third , the service sucks .
fifth and finally , the bread is hard to eat .
there are no silverware to save you from the embarrassment of using your hands .
kind of pricey for a plain sandwich , no drink etc .
this was would be a nice side salad , not a lunch .
so a hit and a two misses .
ok , uh , what ?
she said they could n't do that .
it 's unfortunate their menu only has _num_ sandwiches on it .
they market themselves as a sandwich shop but i just do n't buy it .
but , recently they seem to have quality control issues .
a second issue has been seasoning , which used to be perfect .
yikes , this is not customer service of any kind .
not the savory taste i 'm looking for with a chicken salad sandwich .
so , we had similarly high expectations for the pane bianco cafe .
we were disappointed .
if we were n't starving , we would 've gone elsewhere .
not kid friendly !
looking over the menu , i noticed the kids menu was slim to none .
the decor is painfully cute .
why not just make something that tastes good ?
the chicken was good but there was n't much of it .
but i wo n't be doing it again .
whenever i get to phoenix , i always stop by for some bread .
the young girl behind the counter told me they were n't open until _num_ .
she again told me no .
she again told me no .
went for dinner on a tuesday at _num_ pm ( july _num_ ) .
drove _num_ minutes to have a meal here .
waste of my time to try a new place .
however , the service was so bad , i wo n't be back .
ummmm that 's weird , but fine .
_num_ mins later , we are done eating .
not cool .
this place is foul .
a recent lunch with _num_ colleagues was disappointing in terms of service and food .
overall , a disappointing experience .
huge , let me repeat this , huge mistake !
that was a completely wasted lunch for me .
disappointing & unfriendly staff .
the sandwiches are alright , however there are no sides or chips .
they should stick to pizza !
i ordered the monday sandwich of the day and a pizza for my son .
low value , mediocre food and bad service equals no thanks .
the food was cold .
i had soggy french toast .
they had a container that was yellow like butter but looked like oil .
the chai tea was lukewarm but tasted okay .
the hash browns were shredded potatoes , they were n't crispy .
it was unremarkable .
the meat was salty and tasteless .
very expensive for a bowl of soup just over $ _num_ .
also the very small potato chips for the kettle bag is $ _num_ .
i 'm not sure when or if i 'll be back again , personally .
i 'm being generous - they do n't deserve the star .
i sat down at a table .
i simply got up and walked out .
when i go to a restaurant , i do not beg for service .
i visited g & d during the light rail pub crawl .
when we walked in , my crew headed straight to the bar .
then i had to yell to her that we were ready .
did she just not want our money that day ?
i was starving so i 'm not sure about authenticity or flavor .
i 'll try that if i ever visit g & d again .
it 's at minimum a heavy vinegar / buffalo sauce , thai chilis ?
for this and the cider alone i 'm returning .
this took the _num_ to a _num_ .
that and it did n't come with the horseradish on the menu .
the entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building .
unfortunately , the food is not so great .
i 'm not sure what was up with that .
this place just is n't good enough .
hair in food is just plain gross .
on another night , the scotch eggs followed the same theme .
beer selection was good , but food was terrible .
the food was not good and actually made me and my friend very sick .
i really wanted to like this place but it just was n't good .
i could not believe this bar served food .
nothing about it said restaurant .
there was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did .
could i have asked for our server ?
what a waste of time !
i 've only been here once and it was ok .
steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney ?
g & d was a sad day for me .
menu for food was quite typical .
i personally do n't get what draws people to this place .
it 's got a bit of a negative vibe .
the staff is not friendly or service oriented and it 's dirty .
recently i have noticed a big down turn in the staff at this pub .
my last visit was months ago and i could n't wait to leave .
it 's just not fun anymore .
so long , george .
as i could see there was one bartender and one waitress .
we could n't get a drink or even order food .
it 's a dark bar , my date liked the english vibe of it .
i 've just been to better karaoke bars ( i.e .
it tasted like weak kool-aid .
`` d '' : said even his beer was n't good .
i feel like all their drinks are super watered down .
however we also ordered food , cause i was starving .
i just do n't see the appeal of the place .
i would rather spend my money elsewhere .
there were maybe _num_ or _num_ occupied tables -- it was n't busy .
_num_ servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us .
before we could ask for waters our server ran away .
no flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare .
the steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen .
our wait staff was non existent .
she never bothered to check on us once .
it tasted like water before .
any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice .
and they are n't cheap drinks , so that 's ridiculous .
would have given it zero stars .
the waitress was awful .
to add insult to the visit , i got food poisoning !
i would n't recommend this place at all ... .
but the service was inexcusable .
for an english pub the fish and chips were average at best .
the service was very poor because they were too busy and had little staff .
unfortunately , that did n't happen and we ended up leaving .
unfortunately , it 's not pleasant .
it 's almost like they do n't give a crap about the restaurant tables .
the burger ordered was just okay , but i could n't help feeling awkward .
wo n't be back .
on a busier night , we could n't get service to save our lives .
but time has not been kind to this place .
we walked out , and warned other patrons going in .
avoid this place .
terrible service .
unfortunately it was a huge let down .
that we were here there were several tables that never got cleared .
there certainly were a lot of regulars ( not ordering food ... ) .
this place is dirty , the owner is miserable and the food is terrible .
i just do n't get it .
such a shame .
i want to select zero stars but this app wo n't let me .
do not waste time nor money on this place .
the owner is simply terrible and the food is worse .
the place is noisy and dirty .
owner is one angry nasty person .
this place is worse than terrible .
the food is equally terrible .
there are just too many good places to waste time and money here .
i used to like this place as my hang out on friday nights .
i refused because it was not my drinks .
i 'm horrified by the way i got treated this morning .
the said no we do n't know what your talking about .
i said , you ca n't give us water from the tap .
they treated us so bad i would never ever go there to eat .
that 's not how to work with the community .
plus the place was a mess and they had just open .
shame on you racist workers for treating us like that .
stopped by last for dinner while on a biz trip to phoenix .
i commented that his menu was misleading and he 's taking advantage of people .
he walked away no apology no `` thank you for your business . ''
sadly , the george and dragon is n't what it used to be .
they were inedible - overcooked to death and hard as a rock .
the only thing edible on her plate were the chips ( french fries ) .
i ca n't order from the bar .
the server refused to serve me because the barista had my card .
she would n't even bring me my card .
let me get up , go to the bar and wait .
because why would i want to cone back to this .
the hostess did n't even know what the beers were .
wo n't be back .
not only this visit , several past visits .
servers too busy chatting , hiding , you name it .
bartender is extremely slow to prepare drinks .
did i mention there were only _num_ patrons .
seems like management is non existent .
too bad .
even then it was n't all that great .
rude .
probably will not be back .
george and dragon sucks .
no wonder the place was a ghost town and smells like garbage !
the staff was not helpful and in fact turned out to be extremely rude .
she made no effort to correct this gross service .
this is a dangerous and unhelpful bar and grill in my experience .
if i could give less i would .
the food is somehow worse than before ?
the butt end and that was it .
the french fries were awful .
i never in a million years thought they could make the food worse .
i feel bad for the waitresses .
i 'm actually kinda sad about it because my hopes were pretty high .
fire your entire kitchen staff and start over , or just stop serving food .
wish i could give no stars on this one .
i do n't even know where to start with this bad experience .
our food did n't arrive for _num_ mins .
and overall the food sucked .
she does n't get our checks to us for about _num_ mins .
she still got it wrong .
and shows no effort to take it off of my bill .
she was just getting everything wrong .
she somehow has lost his card .
so overall , my experience here was a nightmare .
you will never catch me in that place again .
could a fooled me !
food was pretty good and the beer was cold but service really was bad .
make this an unappealing place to hang out .
most miserable worst experience ever .
looking forward to going here for weeks , big let down .
mashed potatoes and cold bits of hamburger .
the manager would n't even assist when we asked for our tab .
ridiculous .
this place will not earn our business again .
as far as dive bars go , this one is pretty bad .
they have the worst service i 've ever seen in a pub .
their food is n't much better .
they are consistency awful .
it was a huge portion of bland food .
would not recommend .
fianc had a bland burger , although the fries were tasty .
sad thing is the service is worse than before .
waitress brought out a drink with water and ice .
she really though scotch comes on the rocks by default .
really does n't matter .
i 'm not coming back .
damn shame .
a bit disappointed .
sunday noon , about _num_ patrons .
no one seemed to be in a hurry to wait on customers .
beer was chilled , not cold .
took about _num_ minutes to get potato skins after we placed our order .
there was no issue with that .
the reason why they get only _num_ stars is for poor customer service .
very disappointed .
never come to take an order .
he said he could get it done within a week , no problem .
so , i gave him the job .
long story short ... this went on for over two weeks !
very frustrating to say the least !
i said nothing and walked .
these people are idiots .
places like this seem to have a really difficult staffing problem .
instead i would have to pay $ _num_ for the additional small box .
horrible service , horrible attitudes .
it was very disappointing .
awkward and slow .
you then never refund my money and i never get my package delivered .
that 's worst case but even then it could get worse !
just went here to discuss getting some items printed .
do not past go , do not give your $ _num_ .
but you know why we could n't do the copies ourselves ?
just absolutely frustrating .
i would not recommend this office at all .
i hardly trusted them to give it another go .
my stylist greeted me and immediately complemented me on my necklace .
her assistant immediately complemented me on my boring skirt .
when i paid for my mediocre cut the girl complemented me on my ring .
the end result is nothing like the pictures and is very dull and plain .
i could have saved myself $ _num_ and gone to super cuts .
i would not recommend this salon unless you know the specific hair dresser .
the cut was crooked and the layers where a mess .
i would stay away from this place unless you know specific hairdresser .
i assume it is to get you hooked and come back .
not happening .
the girls were nice but my make up sucked .
i would not recommend this place .
the cigars did n't draw well and were generally not very good .
we wo n't be going back .
recently visited modern lighting , and would never purchase from that store .
nothing broke nor even fell over .
i recomend no one shop here .
horrible business ethics all around .
no thanks .
upon entering we were greeted by a friendly `` no drinks allowed ! ''
really now , get over yourself .
he is rude and arrogant .
there 's too much junk otherwise .
needless to say , i will not be going back .
this man ( the owner ) does n't even deserve to be in business .
he needs to put the lamp shade on and turn on the light !
incredibly poor , aweful service .
he does n't even deserve _num_ star .
i wish i could give him no stars .
treats grown ups like little children .
if i 'm not his target customer , who the hell is ?
yikes , run !
how disappointing .
wow i wish i had read these reviews before walking into this store .
wish i could give this place less than _num_ star .
i wish i can give zero stars .
when i asked why owner said because is my store .
i am never going back or buying there .
do n't waste your time .
the owner of this store deserves no stars !
i do not understand how he stays in business .
guess what , he threw him out too , lol .
this man is a real joke , do not even attempt to shop there .
`` i 'm sorry , we do n't do counter checks . ''
you are a bank and do n't even carry $ _num_ .
on top of the awful stench , the teacher sucked .
it 's unfortunate the hygiene was n't up to par .
it 's bad for bikram and damn , it 's really inconvenient for me .
i desperately missed my down dogs .
i 'm disappointed .
my former studio definitely had a smell but it was nothing like this .
_num_ students new to bikram were allowed to practice in the front row .
this place does not even deserve a one star !
so rude !
because apparently , you need to know all the bikram .
horrible .
sick .
this place simply nasty .
honestly , made me sick .
i would never suggest this place to anyone .
smelly , moldy and just plain gross !
i 'm sure there are better places to try in town !
the yoga studio smelled like sweaty socks , it was unbearable !
this time i was being charge $ _num_ ?
they tried calling a number that i never gave them .
he then walks off .
is he going to call me , should i call him ?
but he wo n't let me talk to anyone else .
stay far far away !
this place is an absolute joke .
avoid this place at all costs !
take the time to put tape on your box before dropping off !
i do n't keep packing tape at home because i do n't ship much .
it 's pretty rotten of them to charge a whole dollar for it .
if not , i will use my own strip of tape .
this store lost my package .
they were nice though .
poor customer service for the owner !
i checked my po box and no package .
so i left .
everyone ( including eric , the owner ) were friendly and helpful .
he said there was nothing wrong with the bike .
he said it was the way i rode it .
i wore my station hat in the pig .
eric became all sorts of friendly and helpful .
the service sucks at the pig .
buy your bike else where , like tempe bikes .
no problem , they said have it ready in two days .
a week after that and it was not done .
another _num_ weeks after that and it was not done .
the brake pads perhaps , they were different , but the tube ?
that was disappointing .
it seems like a cool place , but this was really a bad experience .
two stars for their work , zero for service .
i meant to add this just after i wrote the entry .
it was true for the whole short week since i purchased it from walmart .
i get it , you 're busy .
the point is , that when i went there , they started from scratch .
so i 've been to every bike shop in town .
my first experience with the pig was trying to buy a high-end mountain bike .
but back to the pig .
i gave him the shock and it was sent in to fox .
fox called the shop and told them my shock was no longer available .
eric again was not willing to help .
needless to say , i will never be going back to this shop again .
i am very disappointed and will spread the word about this terrible bike shop .
if i could give _num_ stars i would .
this review is no different .
if they had provided those answers , they would have made a sale .
in the past _num_ weeks , i stopped by the shop _num_ times .
unbelievable .
ignore me once , shame on you .
ignore me twice , shame on me .
ignore me three times , get _num_ star on yelp .
bottom line , i do n't recommend this place .
bang bang bang bang !
out the door , $ _num_ for repairs .
customer service very , very poor !
not so !
we spoke with the owner eric and he said that was not true .
if you want to be treated like sh*t , this is the place .
i certainly will not patronize this place again .
terrible !
tried asking questions to get more information and refused to help .
the service sucked as my server struggled to refill my soda just once .
not because i thought it had potential or was even that hungry .
if you can help it , avoid ordering the sausage .
in fact , if it 's not made of eggs , do n't bother .
they wo n't make it right .
and do n't bother complaining to the manager .
dude probably does n't even know what eggs benedict is supposed to look like .
hubby insisted we had eaten here before .
the oreo pancake is sadly the best thing on the table .
i am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants .
i ordered the taco salad for my lunch .
what a disappointment !
this salad was not worth $ _num_ .
all in all , i wo n't come back here .
we left full , the food run of the mill .
needless to say , i wo n't be back .
i simply pushed my plate away , finished the meeting , paid my bill .
the staff all seems to be in some other world though .
the service is consistently bad , slow , and inattentive .
eating out with a small child is a nightmare here .
good food , poor service .
but today it should have been called suck eggs .
the service is ok but the food was terrible !
i had eggs benedict and i was greatly disappointed !
i 'm giving one star , because there is no negative star .
it 's _num_ , time update your menu & restaurant .
he comes back with cream , no napkins .
that 's no big deal , i do n't care .
friend _num_ had an even more crispy looking omelet .
friend _num_ got a turkey sandwich .
it was dry , and lacking in well ... turkey !
check your cold storage bins people !
friend _num_ has a major strawberry allergy .
as a former employee of this location , i 'm sorely disappointed .
boy was i wrong .
the food was bland and not good at all .
i could n't even finish my meal it was that bad .
how disappointing .
the food is bland and unhealthy .
the price is cheap but not a bargain .
the service is mediocre to poor .
no surprise .
service sucked .
then the waitress just continued to disappear over and over again .
if we needed anything ... ketchup , fork , check , etc forget it .
my gf decided french toast was fine .
no info on the ingredients .
i point out that there 's no info on that sheet either .
he 's super pissed at this point .
i tell him to go away and get me someone else to help .
i stopped in there hoping maybe i would have better luck .
to make a long story short , they got it wrong .
basically told me i was s out of luck .
very unfortunate customer service .
this was not a custom mix either .
now i remember why we switched to home depot paint .
`` nobody 's ever ordered one of those here before . ''
and even that was n't good .
after waiting half an hour i requested a refund .
they did refund my money .
in our time there perhaps there were _num_ patrons , including us .
the soda ( self serve ) was nothing to write about .
just do n't go there to eat .
garbage .
there the guy at the counter told me they did n't have my pictures .
apparently my order was n't anywhere in their system .
alright , whatever .
he does n't .
i grab them , and ask where my candy is .
i did n't care .
i would n't be writing this review if that was it .
so they ca n't blame it on remodeling confusion .
they are just dumb .
and if i were reviewing just the store i would say it was fantastic .
he let out another sigh .
skip this place and make an appointment somewhere else !
feel free to take your money elsewhere . ''
i 'm sick of waiting here and eating my time for my prescriptions .
i am taking my business elsewhere .
so i get hung up again .
then i asked for the store manager , which was already standing behind me .
says there 's nothing he can do .
these days want a paycheck but do n't want to work for it !
in september of _num_ my vehicle was damaged by a tree in their property .
not that great in volleyball .
aaron brothers we 're overpriced mart .
aaron brothers you 'll never see thomas s. again mart .
aaron brothers got your ass yelped on yelp mart .
i purchased a _num_ x _num_ print recently that i planned on framing .
she informed me that it could be ready july 30th , exactly one month .
how the hell do they stay in business ?
i did notice that there were two employees present and one customer , me .
no surprises there .
avoid this place !
the service was horrible !
this place needs better service .
the owner commented , and is still rude and lying in her comments .
she invited me in her comment to try another salon .
no thanks .
worst customer service ever .
she spoke to me as if i were below her .
i have never been treated so poorly in my life .
they soooo so rudely brought me in back to the room .
and then told me i didnt know what i was talking about .
such a rude rude rude woman .
is n't that what they signed up for ?
i 'm sorry , but i am more than just two parts !
my sister was treated so rude .
and my god was i disappointed .
i highly recommend you skip wendy 's for breakfast .
they towed my car today because i did not eat in the restaurant .
now have to wait until monday to get my car .
wendy 's of _num_ e indian school , i hope you read this .
my kudos to that poor woman .
i timed it and once again i waited over _num_ minutes for my food .
i have no hesitation in giving this review one star .
will not be back to this location .
so incredibly gross .
so gross .
gross .
do n't go here , for the love of god !
this place has gone downhill .
every time i go here , i order the same thing .
every time i get the wrong items .
i 'm getting real tired of it .
it 's seriously not that hard .
it really was n't busy .
what i got was _num_ sandwiches no cheese and all of them had lettuce .
this is getting ridiculous .
so i 'm at wendy 's only because i saw an ad on tv .
yes i know the food never looks like it does in the commercials .
but they have baked potatoes .
what other fast food joint has baked potatoes ?
i drove out of my way just to get me some baked potato !
they 're out of baked potatoes .
`` now that 's just stupid '' as stupid as running out of potatoes .
this place do n't even service there restrooms often like other places .
the ghost pepper fries is a waste of money if you like spicy food .
not spicy at all .
asked the cashier again , she said she would talked to the manager .
well my hour lunch is over so i 'll find somewhere else to go .
this was a total disappointment .
i would give it no stars if i could .
i went there saturday , bit into a burger and it tasted like fish .
the management was none too concerned .
there is almost a screw up every time .
but wait ... did you call the desk after talking to the dr ?
uh , do n't you know that is your job ?
after me and my husband waited for _num_ months to get our initial appt .
the coordinator for phoenix va should be ashamed .
what a nightmare !
it does however take me awhile to get an appointment .
frankly this is a disgusting way to treat our vets .
( make that _num_ minutes ... .
are these the kind of employees the phoenix va have as support staff ?
worst customer service ever !
still no treatment or diagnosis as to what is going on .
it 's _num_ months between appointments .
my needs were not for a cold or a cut finger .
i think that is a shame in itself .
this review honestly does n't include the va 's er department .
and nobody else will , '' ( lie number _num_ ) .
i 've never been to a worse medical facility in my life .
you should be fucking embarrassed of yourselves .
this place is an absolute joke .
from _num_ to _num_ , i waited to check in .
the blood draw itself took under _num_ seconds total .
i accepted this appointment , having no other choice .
having no other choice i accepted this new appointment .
`` drug them up and send them home '' should be the motto .
no actual health care being done anymore !
such a shame we ca n't even trust our own health care system !
the parking is ridiculous .
i drove around for an hour to avoid valet parking still nothing .
then finally had to use valet just to wait another hour .
the doctors and staff can be rude and non caring .
this place really need to be more organized .
i wasted a half tank of gas just trying to find parking .
a week later i get a call to bring the copies .
a week later i get a call to come in and discuss it .
this place has a bad reputation for a reason .
if you have the ability , avoid them like the plague .
however the va system cant provide the medical care that i need .
he was very thorough and was constantly typing while asking me questions .
slight language barrier , i think he is of russian descent .
he got everything wrong and i had to correct him !
a mistake here would definitely cause some serious problems !
_num_ weeks later .
my thumbs are tired so i 'll quit for now .
i forgive them but it 's just unacceptable to mess up more than twice .
the doctors & nurses are wonderful but out biggest complaint is the scheduling .
pros : the corn bread , green beans , and creamed spinach were delicious .
that is totally unacceptable !
fast food salad , pasta and pizza .
the salad was your standard plate of bland greens .
despite the high convenience factor , i will not be back .
for years , i had passed by but was never impressed by their menu .
pasta items are in the $ _num_ range + $ _num_ for chicken .
went there for lunch and had a chicken chopped salad .
there was not a lot of chicken and it was not cheap !
as i was walking up ( after 1:30 ) i saw their specials .
or maybe i just had my taste buds set for lemon chicken .
it also cost more than it should .
the staff was friendly , i mean at least they smiled .
car stuff 's expensive .
the autozone kid was super helpful though .
autozone has recently changed their battery testing policy and equipment .
came across a very terrible worker here .
could not help me for nothing .
lazy lazy lazy !
this store is no longer open .
it 's completely empty and nobody is answering the phone or emails either .
no , thanks .
the poor wait staff .
and the food is just not good .
the budget did n't include morton 's or ruth 's chris .
ok , ok , ok , too much of the extras .
the clientele was like a scene out of dawn of the dead .
skip the entrees .
my fav 's were the spinach dip and the wings .
the chips tasted freshly made but were a little greasy for my liking .
so , i ate there on wednesday and it is now friday .
next time i visit phoenix this will not be where i go .
waited _num_ min .
walked out after _num_ more min and no sign of server or salads ... .
i was very disappointed to say the least .
host was not very personable , but we gave it a chance .
wrong idea .
we waited _num_ min , not even a greet or anything .
we seen all sorts of servers walk by our table , ignoring us .
will never i back .
their quesadilla burger gave me food poisoning .
wait time , well _num_ min .
horrible .
unable to eat .
left without eating .
just horrible .
terrible service sitting at the bar for happy hour .
unfortunately tonight 's visit was far from superb as we are used to .
she responded with , `` i was not aware of that request . ''
he turned my experience around for such an awful beginning .
i 've never had such filthy food via delivery before .
add insult to injury they did n't even include my side of veggies .
worst experience !
not coming back to this particular applebees .
wait was terrible on a late thursday night .
finally seated , _num_ mins before they took our order .
food came out , cold and or overcooked .
only good thing was our waiter , he was doing his best .
will not be returning with all the late night choices down central .
last i checked i 'm pretty sure that was the servers job .
the entrees are not that great .
i have ordered a steak and pasta here before and they 're nothing special .
the food is n't worth that kind of treatment .
food was disgusting .
there was not enough people on the floor to help the server out .
was not happy with the food !
on july 2nd , _num_ , we visited this applebee 's .
he brought us _num_ napkins & _num_ forks .
that is unacceptable .
very disappointing & a terrible experience .
once seated , we then wait for our waiter to arrive .
my girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions .
looked strange at first but whatever we went with it , we were hungry .
next time attempt to act like you care .
none have ever been great .
stood around for at least _num_ minutes before we were seated .
she was no where to be seen for several minutes .
it tasted bad .
she just wrote down the wrong thing .
our meal was ruined .
this is the worst applebee 's ever .
staff was friendly , restaurant was moderately clean .
after much discussion they cooked another egg .
i wo n't be back .
it took very long to have drinks ordered after being sat .
this place is ridiculous .
servers gave us a pissed off look when we did .
meals came back looking under the heat lamp sad and limp .
meal was overall gross !
too many other good restaurants in phoenix .
except mine was wrong and i ask for the right entree .
the waitress seem irritated that i just did n't take what she brought me .
no one ever apologized at all .
they tried to make it seem like it was our fault .
i will never step foot in that restaurant again and will contact corporate .
it was absolutely horrible burger and even more horrible experience .
no stars for food or location of central and camelback !
drove _num_ minutes out to come to applebee 's .
went here again and they were closed _num_ minutes early .
it 's unacceptable .
i was very disappointed in the quality of food !
there 's a _num_ , _num_ , and _num_ ? ''
_num_ percent chance this is me .
i ca n't stand castle boutique .
it 's terrible .
stopped in here a few months back .
why does phoenix not have better sex toy stores ?
unfortunately , this location has gone downhill over the years .
staff seems a bit apathetic .
one left to ring a customer up and came back .
`` , which as a side note i thought was somewhat rude .
you ca n't even give me a `` hello .
i was waiting on you .
i went to cheese 'n stuff to buy cheese and the choices were laughable .
it 's not even a cheese shop .
the first thing i noticed when i walked into the place was the smell .
there were no specialty cheeses or meats .
one of the deli cases actually just had chips in it .
do n't understand the high rating this restaurant is getting ?
well folks , you yelpers here are totally fooled !
it 's not !
for starters , my friend and i ordered sizzling rice soup .
both dishes were supposed to be hot ... not !
it was very meh .
it was very bland .
the rice was n't cooked well at all ... seriously , wtf ?
the soup that came out beforehand was nothing to write home about .
if i could give china chili less than one star , i would .
but you 're better off going elsewhere if you want good chinese food .
that 's a definite sign that the quality is sub-par .
a lot of people from work seem to like to go here .
after being there several times i still dont get what the fuss is .
as far as taste goes , i have had better .
really not sure what the fuss is about .
i 'm only half asian so i 'm not sure if my opinion counts .
the menu is standard for a chinese restaurant nothing special .
the beef was chewy and the chow mein was bland .
i do not understand why people love china chili .
i would n't recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy !
i ordered the orange chicken , fried rice , soup , and crab puffs .
i wo n't be coming back .
over priced mediocre food .
i was dissatisfied with this place after reading all the rave reviews .
pork fried rice , lemon chicken , and sweet and sour chicken .
chewy flavorless pork and little rice rocks were in abundance .
it really had no flavor at all .
it is hard to mess up this dish , but somehow , they did .
sweet and sour chicken .
food is typical of phoenix chinese food , very boring .
after everything i 'd heard of the place , i was expecting alot more .
will not be back .
i have eaten in restaurant only a handful of times .
the service is friendly but lacking .
the vegetables are always overcooked , mushy and taste oily .
that is not good chinese food .
not sure i will be back , possibly for lunch for the orange chicken .
my first review of china chili was _num_ stars .
after today 's experience i am down to _num_ star .
i had kung pao chicken and my wife had lemon chicken .
i like it spicey but this was just sour .
nasty !
another disappointment .
within hours , i suffered severe symptoms of food poisoning .
this is direct cause and effect .
meantime there is no way i would ever return .
the prawns were good but nothing special .
i only ate _num_ or _num_ bites .
the sesame chicken was the same way .
some of the ladies who were waitresses there , however , were not friendly .
bland taste for what this restaurant 's reputation has in the neighborhood .
i was not impressed at all .
i had sweet and sour chicken , pork fried rice and wonton soup .
nothing to write home about .
it did n't wow me .
oh no no no no !
i will not be back !
i ordered the teriyaki chicken spicy and the crab puffs .
the taste of the chicken was gross .
i thought at one point i may have gotten duck or something .
not good at all .
the crab puffs were awesome .
i will not be returning though .
the food is underwhelming !
i told my husband at the end to tell the staff they lack beef .
just the worst chinese food ever .
lacks in flavor regardless of dish and the meat was just suspect .
you will be disappointed that you did n't listen .
pretty disappointed after reading other reviews .
overpriced chinese food and only tasted mediocre at most .
we never got enough silverware or soup bowls .
i also told her the soup was cold .
this was not the first time i 've had a complaint with china chile .
they always have an excuse !
i will never spend another dollar in that establishment .
the atmosphere makes you feel cheap and cheated .
so i only ate half of each .
food was horrible .
we got a fried rice , which was not too bad .
we returned the beef because it was not edible .
they get five star 's it was the food .
first there was no crab in the crab cheese puffs , just cream cheese .
nothing i would order again its clear they have a loyal customer base .
it may take another try , but for me that wont be anytime soon .
we ordered _num_ different dishes and from ordering to delivery was 5-7 minutes literally .
a water refill should n't take longer then preparing _num_ dishes .
walked out when i realized they put msg in their food .
rather get of pf changs or pei wei .
even panda express does n't use msg .
it 's bad stuff .
i have no idea why this place is so highly rated .
sat for _num_ minutes and flagged someone for an order .
soup for the lunch specials came out after the food , was n't good .
i do n't know what it was but it was awful .
however , the food was very bland .
even the egg rolls were bland .
watered down sauce .
unfortunately i can not recommend this restaurant .
something has changed big time !
find a better florist , they 're out there .
will not be using them again .
they were awful .
there is a huge lack in management here .
these are just plan bad .
the baked goods section is full of wraps , pretzels , etc .
i just paid $ _num_ for two drinks .
the kale is n't fresh it 's frozen .
the drinks are good but not worth the price .
no greeting ... nothing .
no offer to help .
i will urge anyone i know to stay away .
they then price them up using various price guides .
now -- records in pretty bad shape and prices way too high .
not much love for music just about making money .
all i know is that this place smells like old tuna .
the cheap kind .
i do n't care if it 's inconsistent , but just be nice .
i just want my dive bars to have some life .
average drink prices these days , nothing special .
the first thing we noticed was that there were n't any dishes .
it was amazingly gross .
i 'm never going back to this location again .
after coming here a week ago , we found that it has gotten worse .
this used to be my daughter 's favorite restaurant .
now , she does n't even want to come here again .
i have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst .
i took one and it was cold and soggy .
the frozen desert , chocolate , had no taste at all .
it was cold , creamy and without any flavoring .
i will not be returning .
the salad bar lacked all kinds of meat for the salads .
is n't it a buffet ?
lost their lease , building to be torn down .
these guys have no class what so ever .
they made a big issue out of nothing .
these guys are the terrible !
these guys will never admit to any wrong doing for the sake of anything .
you can almost feel how damn fake they really are !
the worst ever !
so , i figured i would try it .
it was almost embarrassing being the only asian person in the place .
i 'm really torn on the number of stars this rating should be .
we did n't go inside , so i ca n't really judge the place .
i hate egg rolls but i would order one of those again .
my orange chicken , however , was tough and rubbery .
we went through the drive-thru around 8pm last wednesday .
both bowls and gyoza came to $ _num_ with tax .
veggies and chicken were okay too .
i guess the whole bowl was just okay .
the sauce served with them were good though .
all in all , not my dream dinner , but just okay .
it 's plain white rice with teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken .
this is a $ _num_ bowl of disgusting crap .
i do n't care .
it comes out to about $ _num_ per bowl .
unable to complete simple orders .
i do n't see how i could possibly trust their food safety .
there was almost no teriyaki sauce on my meal first of all .
secondly the rice was not well cooked .
horrible !
i 'm still not sure what a spent $ _num_ on .
over that time the service has declined tremendously .
( referring to a veggie sushi roll item ) .
and the cashier just stood there trying not to laugh !
of course i drove off in a fit and hungry haha .
`` , but the manager said they were not doing anymore today .
i looked at the employee and she just shrugged .
digging into the teriyaki chicken i found a lot of vegetables and little chicken .
this low grade dog food would n't even cut it for a discount special .
ordered _num_ chicken teriyaki bowls and one salad at drive through .
not reputable business .
then again , i wouldnt really consider this a reputable business .
they hardly speak english , and i felt an icy discomfort upon entering .
they had no interest in talking to any of their clients .
the haircut was expensive for a barber shop and not good .
bad idea .
bad business .
i was then appalled to hear that my haircut cost $ _num_ !
what the hell ?
do n't get the old blond lady !
well no wonder her chair was empty , she 's a horrible barber !
hair was cut uneven everywhere , if there was any hair left !
nope , i 'm not going back !
they lost my lunch business for today .
very limited seating .
my only concern was how well they cleaned the blizzard machine .
just looked like it needed some cleaning .
no one got sick so probably fine too .
i find this very strange and annoying .
it is small and seating is limited but that never really bothered me .
i gave him my credit card and he ran it .
i guess they just have a slow credit card machine .
i am disgusted with the restaurant !
they were rather rude regarding their poor flower selection and life of their flowers .
it was n't particularly busy , maybe about ten people all up .
walked around .
put down papers .
talked to someone else .
wo n't be back .
it is like i am a joke to them .
i dont pay that much money for someone not to do their job .
dont consider it .
you will be very dissapointed and your needs will not be met .
what morons , for _num_ months they continued to send mail there .
worse property management company i have encountered !
very unhappy with both .
for _num_ years never one complaint .
he is still not satisfied .
get a better vendor .
if i could leave _num_ stars i would .
worst hoa i have ever had .
they ding you again with another _num_ dollar online payment fee !
update your technology and your slow unhelpful staff .
in my opinion this company does not care about our home values .
very weak management company in my opinion .
for about _num_ pieces of pepper and onion .
hard times , qdoba ?
i need some now .
i was one of only _num_ customers to come in the whole time .
when i pay i ask why they are so slow .
she says they have been slow all day .
you would think if they were slow all day the place would be spotless .
fail !
you barely get the _num_ stars because the burrito was good .
i do n't eat meat or pork , so i only wanted chicken .
no restaurant should ever run out of something like chicken !
automatic low rating .
because i had never been there , i was looking over their menu .
for a restaurant that did n't seem busy at all i would expect cleanliness .
i am going to stick with chipotle all the way .
my first experience with this restaurant will be the only one .
was located near starbucks but no longer there .
the bagels and cream cheese were good , but not outstanding .
the real negative for me was the restroom .
however , that is not their problem .
their business practices are awful .
i am _num_ for _num_ .
first time shame on them , second time shame on me for going back .
ripoff !
bad business !
i went back another time and it still was n't ready .
terrible service and no apology for the fact they they totally dropped the ball .
i was in the place _num_ minutes and was not greeted once .
ok , way out of my price range .
very disappointed with our purchase and the service we received afterwards .
they were slow to get back to us so we went into the store .
not ethical in my books .
there still is n't an answer .
not to mention yogurt etc .
really hurt by the experience .
neither the staff nor the doctors seemed to genuinely care about the animals .
pathetic !
there is no `` exam '' , just a scam for more money .
the only good thing about this visit was the receptionist .
then why did i pay $ _num_ ?
why should i pay you to research potential problems online ?
this was not the vet i have seen in the past .
complete waste of time any money !
seriously i want my $ _num_ back .
_num_ stars .
borderline _num_ .
i just was n't impressed .
i thought for sure this would become my home away from home .
probably not .
i wanted to sit in the den , where the brews are crafted .
hardly anyone was there .
speaking of bar , i was excited to try their vanilla porter .
well , she did n't get it .
the kick and finish of this beer did not impress me .
the layout of the place was somewhat unusual .
the two beers that i had were decent but not amazing .
the service was awful .
nothing good or personable about it .
next time i 'll take the extra _num_ minutes to get to four peaks .
also i noticed the menu was really , really random .
they do n't specialize in any particular type of food .
fish and chips , and then some southwestern dishes ... .
whatever , i appreciate small , local restaurants but this place is all wrong .
at that point i 'm never coming back .
the weather was fabulous .
she returned a few minutes later for our order .
next time i 'll just try sitting at the bar .
atmosphere was very lame for a thursday night .
the majority of the beer was just plain boring , and warm to boot !
even the root beer was flat and tasteless .
i really , really want to like it .
the waitress was n't very friendly and seemed to be uninterested in being pleasant .
shame i paid $ _num_ to upgrade from regular fries .
my companion saw she was just standing around in the back not doing anything .
mediocre food ... if it was what i ordered .
the beer was ok but nothing great compared to other breweries around town .
i really wanted to like this place , sadly disappointed .
wo n't go back ... the owners really need to step in !
wow .
big mistake .
shrimp tacos : way too salty and overcooked .
macaroni & cheese : not bad , but it 's mac & cheese .
for the price food was n't that great either .
from our three drinks ordered , we only got two .
it was also a bit dry .
no salt , no vinegar , nothing .
been here before and it was way better than this last thursday !
the relatively indifferent waitress informed me that they were out .
well , i tried it and did n't like it .
no big deal .
that was before she completely ignored our table for _num_ mins .
my favorites were the hefeweizen and vanilla porter .
very disappointed in their service .
the waitress would grab the beer and scoop out the ticket .
i will not be back .
the problem lies with the horrible service .
after _num_ minutes , i made mention that we still did n't have them .
another girl said the order must have not made it to the kitchen .
another _num_ minutes had passed and i then told the bartender .
it took another _num_ minutes on top of that .
never once did anyone bother telling me what happened .
honestly , no one even gave a sh*t either .
my buddy even commented on that after we left .
no one even cared .
clearly the first person did n't put the order in .
i wo n't be going back .
they were the ones conveniently located at the bottom of the stack .
i hate being asked , then end up disappointed .
starting off , the pasta was over cooked .
i really doubt we will return .
if you 're into great craft beer , do n't waste your time here .
not impressed at all .
poor service , decent beer , poor food .
next time , i 'll buy a _num_ pack and host my own gathering .
unbelievably horrible service .
our first experience was ruined by a very rude waitress .
no more to be said ... it sucks i wanted to enjoy my visit .
all of this with only _num_ people in the restaurant and _num_ wait staff .
very disappointing and not worth the money .
probably _num_ tortilla chips .
i went here last week with a friend to try it out .
i ordered a large mac n cheese and the garlic parmesan fries .
it was n't noted that it was beer mac n cheese either .
unfortunately we both left hungry .
our waitress was nice but it was clear she was ready to go home .
we chose to try to sit at the other bar .
this is one of the worst experiences at a restaurant !
our waitress did not know what was going on the entire time .
my drink was empty the entire time .
beers that were listed they also did not have .
not cabana .
second room given - handicapped cabana room in back corner , no balcony .
however , i find this highly unacceptable .
not a good vibe at all .
not awful - just not good either .
staff was a plus .
i 've almost never had a bad experience w/ hilton staff .
very awkward and inconvenient lay out .
this place is tired on every level .
staff is polite and friendly but thoroughly inefficient and clueless .
never again - not recommended .
ah , and well , they do n't reply to emails either .
it looked cheap .
it is actually tile that looks like dark wood floors .
we thought is was cheap vinyl .
well i got ready to crawl in about _num_ pm .
the bed was awful .
the linens were not hilton quality .
i could have called but that late i did not want to move .
overpriced & horrible housekeeping !
if i had n't prepaid i would have left on the 2nd day .
i was not comped .
motel _num_ service at a hilton price .
just stay somewhere else & save yourself the frustration .
horrible experience .
i stayed at this hotel for a conference in october _num_ .
this happened to several of my other coworkers as well .
the employee did not take the smelly blanket away .
i would absolutely not recommend staying at this hotel .
i did n't actually stay in the hotel & i was glad .
everything about this hotel screamed tired .
beyond the convention cleanliness issue , everything was old & tired .
i did n't get the impression that things were gross , just over used .
i wo n't be staying here any day soon .
the ac was not working in room .
no one to fix at night .
the thermostat had to be _num_ years old .
property could not fix .
terrible layout .
old , tired property .
worst hotel stay in years .
i was scheduled to stay _num_ nights .
how in the heck did someone get a key to my room ?
i called front desk and they sent housekeeping to my room .
not my fault !
( they did comp my room , but still very unacceptable . )
otherwise the service was not consistent and the building is very old .
here are why i am giving only _num_ stars .
- i really liked their chicken noodle soup on the first day .
phoenix light rail runs right along central , or whatever .
in fact , they never even returned my fucking call .
pro tip : light rail drops you off a block from here .
it could use a renovation .
not good for kids .
not good for dogs .
no apple pay !
methinks not . ''
i used to like this doctor , but now i do n't .
i wish i had never gone .
it 's still rough _num_ weeks later and not healed .
you just lost your company a regular client lady .
front office is very unprofessional and rude .
they charge for negative tattoo space so it 's double the price .
aka they are charging for non existing ink in a tattoo area .
makes no sense .
just trying to get more money .
i was n't expecting to have to ever go through this again .
at least not with the same one ?
extremely disappointed with the results of my mini face lift and brow lift .
but now you ca n't even tell i had anything done .
my neck is awful , it looked better before .
just disgusted that i threw my money away .
so , so unhappy .
it 's not worth it to go to this place .
after the surgery i was unhappy and told them that .
even after the second surgery , i am still not happy .
the receptionists treated me poorly .
that is ridiculous .
if i could give this agency no stars , i would .
this starbucks has been remodeled and now looks like a hospital cafeteria .
i hate this new look and will not be back ever !
btw - the place was empty at 10am on a saturday .
it 's starbucks only with bad customer service .
baristas with attitude that do n't know their own product .
he again repeated that i would have to purchase something .
especially when there is no signage stating that the bathrooms are for customers only .
did n't feel like coffee , tea or food today .
office is a little bit old but not too bad .
the customer service ( from the top ) is horrible .
when i buy _num_ or more .
they will not be getting anymore of my money .
a company should not have employees that scream at customers .
worst .
right now my pizza is _num_ minutes late .
i 'm cooking and will refuse it when it gets here .
i was threatened by the delivery driver after he messed up my delivery address .
i got no where which the corporate office also .
lousy customer service .
she supposedly even called .
no pizza .
no phone call .
not even an apology or an attempt to make things right .
worst customer service ever .
i would give them no stars at all if i could .
this is unacceptable !
( they never let me finish it ) .
at least she was n't chewing gum .
going over to another agency ... sigh .
she was n't very friendly while working with me .
i drove an hour total through this whole process .
i am _num_ months here , i got lost .
if you 're in an extreme situation she will not help you .
they put me through all that crap just to tell me that !
i was hurt and drove _num_ min to get my finger prints done .
what a horrible system .
i wo n't stop .
horrible .
i kinda felt like it was disorganized .
i am not trying to leave my full time job for that .
dont waste your time !
i refused .
it was a waste of time and gas .
i would waste time with them .
highly ignorant people .
i was told there was nothing she could do ( jessica ) nothing .
disappointing turnover with grill chefs .
she was answering phones and scheduling appointments while working on my nails .
a monkey could have done a better job !
i will never attend this salon again !
i do not get acrylics nor do i get gel polish .
i like a traditional natural manicure and this place does not deliver .
because of the poor quality manicures i will be looking for a new place .
$ _num_ for a gel fill ?
i could have easily trimmed and painted my toes at home .
also all the techs continuously talked to each other and rarely to their clients .
not customer friendly at all .
why is this my fault !
why make an appointment if you ca n't keep it .
and you do bad work !
i had the worst experience here .
it was dirty , unsanitary , and way overpriced !
it 's gross and the people who work here are unprofessional and rude .
the woman who did my nails did a horrific job .
it 's like _num_ dollars more then at other places .
another thing i can not stand is when people ask for cash tips .
i would never ever go back to this place .
this place is so dirty and unprofessional .
avoid at all cost !
i will not be coming back .
i payed $ _num_ for sh*t acrylics .
i could have done them myself and they would have turned out better .
that is not what i asked for .
i can not tell you how upset i was .
she needs to go back to beauty school .
it is honestly not hard to match a picture .
so disappointed .
unless you have an appointment , do n't bother .
their time management is n't very good .
my daughter & i went in for a pedicure .
i was beginning to think she did n't speak english .
i guess she did n't like what my daughter was saying .
this place does n't make you feel welcome .
worst experience .
the nail tech named judy made both of these experiences extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant .
she was very rude and i felt pushed around and like a huge inconvenience .
`` what the hell just happened ? ''
what an absolute dive , and not in a good way .
not even _num_ min !
... it 's a dive bar and not in a good way .
not my favorite strip club by a long shot .
it 's too crowded ; there are too many chairs for this tiny club .
her : ca n't .
her : fuck you , you pig .
i will not return to this establishment again when in the area for business .
i would not consider this a gentlemen club .
the only positive note was they have an extremely friendly bouncer .
service was bad .
the waitress walks off and i take a sip of my drink .
and it 's some kind of harsh house vodka .
the worst part is the `` manager '' never made an appearance .
i 've been to better but there is also worse .
i would give it _num_ stars if i could .
stopped in from out of town and our experience was a nightmare .
there were many waitresses fighting over our table , we were so incredibly uncomfortable .
the owner of this place is probably clueless of what goes on here .
this club goes all out in trying to rip you off .
they constantly give you that `` i wan na fight '' look .
i do n't like getting the cold shoulder .
the staff at this store is very rude .
as though i were in the wrong place .
they definitely lost a customer today -- and for all future visits .
but , it sound horrible .
it just was n't `` smooth '' sounding as you would expect .
i wo n't be going back .
after getting over that the waitress brought over menu and chips and salsa .
took one bite of the salsa , that was it.
threw a buck in the table and walked out .
i went with authentic mexican friends and none were impressed by the food .
i called it mediocre and they called it less than .
furthermore the decor and vibe in the place is lacking .
nothing too special about this place .
i was severely disappointed .
the service was horrible .
the staff was friendly , just incredibly slow .
granted , the restaurant was full .
i 've had better mexican food in alaska .
wo n't be going here again .
not enough cooks & servers to feed the mass of people who eat there .
visited on march _num_ for dinner with a large group .
the chips and salsa were eh , ok .
i ordered a chicken enchilada and a beef taco , no sides .
the food was bland and not too flavorful .
unfortunately , a person in our party found a hair in their taco .
i was disappointed with this dish .
it was greasy and had too much cheese .
it was also fairly bland .
visited juan 's after reading the numerous complementary reviews .
unfortunately , our experience did not come close to that of more enthusiastic reviewers .
this is terrible .
the food is very bland and service is very slow .
the employees act like they 're the only restaurant in town .
do yourself a favor and skip this one .
however , the food in my opinion just is n't good .
the meal was just very disappointing and took over _num_ minutes to serve .
it seemed like your basic run of the milk - nothing special mexican place .
the flavor was very blah .
i was disappointed and to be honest the service was not great .
she did n't even try to fake a friendly smile .
ten minutes later , she just took my plate and walked away .
had they actually informed us , we 'd have gone , no hard feelings .
chips and salsa were old and tasteless .
taco shells were old -- meat was tasteless -- rice was cold .
really , really bad .
sports fans take note : there is no cable tv .
i do n't get it .
the bill was $ _num_ !
completely ridiculous .
over priced and not even that great .
the chicken was so salty and the pizza was burnt .
never going back .
horrible service , whether busy or not .
pizza is always limp , soggy or undercooked .
pizza cookie is ok .
go to scottsdale or tempe location instead .
people would tell me i just `` have to try oreganos '' .
drinks refills took longer than they should have .
no thanks .
i find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait .
not bad , but ok.
the pizza , i just do n't understand the hype .
service was weird , and i 'm pretty sure our server was on coke .
do n't bother .
but i must say the garlic is what ruined it for me .
do n't think i would go there again if i was in town .
this review is not for the food.
this would have been repeat business no less .
as far as pizza goes ... um no thanks .
are you freakin kidding me ?
you did nothing right in this transaction .
it was almost laughable .
but the alfredo the dark with chicken was such a limp noodle for me .
was that really chicken lunch meat sliced thick in my pasta ?
for lunch , really ?
for starters we ordered the bistro calamari & boom dip .
total ( not including tip ) was about $ _num_ .
this was the absolute worst calamari that i ever tasted !
it did n't even look like calamari .
it was thick strips that tasted very very fishy .
we sent it back and ordered fried ravioli .
when it arrived , it too , was way over salted and tasted stale .
the food was great but the service left a bad taste in our mouths .
that said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable .
we said ok , we 'd like to check the bar .
really not cool .
really bad for business .
not what i want to see .
this time i visited the oregano 's on camelback and was pretty disappointed .
no worries , that does not bother me really .
the salad was terrible and i had been so looking forward to it .
however recently something seems a miss .
noodles were doughy and chewy and clearly different sized than the old method .
the chicken was in huge chunks vs the old shredded style .
disappointing since this is a place you are willing to wait for .
staff is also so young and distracted with one another at camelback location .
but now inconsistent food ... drops a notch for me .
i barely finished one slice .
i think food out of a garbage just might taste better .
i would give this place zero stars if i could .
i love oregano 's , but this specific location is terrible .
the food is not prepared as well as the other locations .
it was bland & tasteless and way too oily .
it was simply the worst lasagna we ever had .
costco frozen lasagna is better than this sorry excuse for an entree .
for that reason alone , i ca n't go back .
the hot wings were not good .
the person next to me had the thin crust which looked pretty good .
on top of it all it was a little pricy for pizza .
i would not recommend this place .
food was good , service was terrible .
the whole experience was rude .
will not be back at this location again .
this is no exaggeration .
there is really , seriously no place to park .
i was always very excited to eat here but disappointed once i was there .
everything i ordered was less than awesome .
no exceptions .
awful experience this week .
a quarter of the salad was not edible .
those people just do n't care .
we had the worst service ever !
i was so disappointed !
i had surgery monday and was in pretty poor shape .
sooooo disappointing - i will never again order take out from this restaurant .
tonight ... this place was horrible !
very disappointing !
was n't a fan at all !
sorry , not much positive to say .
i was craving alfredo .
what i got was undercooked boxed pasta with no taste .
but will look elsewhere for my pasta fix .
extremely disappointed with the customer service at the take out counter .
never asked for anything free , and i paid for my entire meal .
however , that 's not an excuse to be unpleasant and rude .
do n't eat here .
the worst experience ever .
our _num_ minute wait was close to an hour .
no apology and definitely no better service .
what used to be out favorite place has gone to shit .
avoid this location .
longest hour of my life so far !
entree salad was fair .
shrimp diablo was too hot .
i love spices food but this was ridiculous .
no bargains here on lunch entree costs .
the food was alright but the customer service was poor .
will not be coming back and would n't recommend .
disappointing .
dip was good , artichokes were a little tough .
we continued to eat and my husband ran out of pepsi , completely .
to be fair i tried oregano 's twice in _num_ different locations .
i have tried lots of pizza in arizona from many different restaurants .
the pizza is sooo marginal .
no really , the pizza lacks flavor and super skimpy on the toppings .
there was barely any pineapple on it .
i will not be back to this place again !
we were so hungry and craving pasta from oregano 's .
at this point , i am super hungry and getting a little frustrated .
i was so mad at that point .
the place is clearly slow .
this was such an awful experience .
very weak knock off of chicago style pizza .
crust was ok and the pizza sauce was bitter .
she the accidentally gave our wings to the customer in front of us .
i was disgusted by their customer service .
no thank you .
my first time at oregano and i got to say i 'm disappointed !
overall a complete waste of money .
ate here yesterday and i 'm never going back .
the salad was good but the pizza took incredibly long to get finished .
finally got refills only to come back with a dead fly in my cup .
overall this place was just a let down .
just a do n't try to pick up food for take out .
i was to frustrated to wait any longer so i just left empty handed .
both visits here were not the best .
it 's the service that seems to be lacking .
this is the worst dry cleaner i have ever gone to , bar none .
man , do i pity dana 's employees .
pathetic .
three strikes , and i gave them the gift of another .
filed complaint with the better business bureau and guess what ?
they have ignored it .
however , the problem just occurred again today .
do n't mind me just getting excited over ranch .
this garbage is the epitome of , well garbage .
gross !
the bad news is the prices are outrageous .
true value usually has lower prices too .
do n't expect exceptional service & you wo n't be disappointed .
the cashier responded with a `` why would we offer you a discount ?
this exchange was not in their policy so they could not do it .
ace i am disappointed in you .
do not get keys made here !
i am so annoyed with this ace .
i had _num_ keys made , _num_ did n't fit .
went back to have the _num_ fixed , _num_ still did n't work .
i got _num_ made , _num_ did n't work ( sound familiar ) .
one of the keys still does n't fit .
everything you might want in customer service is not here .
i 've shopped here several times too many .
management is horrible .
the dishwasher sucks big time !
the security gates are always stuck open , so anyone can come in .
if i could give this place no stars at all , i would .
i can not wait to move out .
if i could give a _num_ 1/2 star i would .
we hardly ever hear our neighbors on the top or bottom of us .
ok , now lets get to the things that are not so great .
the place is still very loud around the apartments .
do not get an apartment facing any of the streets !
the windows are like paper and leak air like crazy .
i come in to eat something real quick side i was still working .
everytime i hit this mcdonalds it 's so slow ... .
_num_ cheeseburgers a fry and a drink .
i was there approximately noon .
the parking lot was full but the dining room was n't .
it did n't take long to give my order or get my food .
no napkin dispenser out where customers can get to them .
does make me wonder when was the last time he or she ate there .
i left _num_ messages with people and _num_ messages on their machine .
no response ever .
communication is horrible .
emails and messages are rarely returned .
she lacks the desire or ability to truly support the owners in our community .
you will not be satisfied as an owner .
i have to constantly fight and argue with those people .
this struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait .
do n't go unless you 're willing to wait , though .
for just a simple pizza sub it was roughly $ _num_ .
when they handed me the sandwich i was really disappointed .
no meat , no seasoning , no nothing .
very disappointing place and the food was n't that great .
i actually felt really awful about myself for having ate it .
i do n't know , i threw them out after one bite .
have been dying to try this kosher place for some time .
went tonight and ordered a large _num_ cheese pizza .
o m g american cheese ?
are you kidding me ?
it was _num_ with a drink .
so sad to see this neighborhood gem go veggie .
the italian was to die for .
got ta say that this place failed on the majority .
service was slow and rude .
sure enough $ _num_ later , he said he could not do it .
we would have to take the engine apart and truck was not worth it .
so , i trusted him and did that .
see , i do n't really like this place .
and i , quite frankly , remain unimpressed .
i 'm down with the fusion , only if it 's done tastefully .
seared tuna ... was far from seared .
sushi rice was a bit soggy too .
i ordered the clams in broth .
that tall white thing we saw was a vanilla cake , not the cheesecake .
i wo n't bother with desserts of fancy drinks next time .
slow service .
sushi was n't bad , not awesome .
so overall ... weird experience ... will it keep me away ?
i opted for the shrimp udon soup .
i did get an added bonus of deep fat smell covering my clothing .
unfortunately this means the food quality has become very inconsistent .
he could n't have been less concerned about serving us .
the tempura we ordered was very blah , nothing to write home about .
i ordered pad thai no tofu again mild .
how can you go wrong with pad thai .
the noodles were so over cooked it was disgusting .
that 's the only good thing i can say .
i have not been back .
my sister has but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth literally .
you get _num_ stars one for decor and one because my sister likes it .
that is n't what is wrong with cherry blossom .
the problem with cherry blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse .
we were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived .
at that point , my wife flagged down the host who took our order .
it just seems to get worse and worse at cherry blossom .
cherry blossom will not be getting any more visits from us .
this particular night , i opted for the miso marinated sea bass .
the server never brought it to me .
not in that order , but you get my drift .
if anybody 's thinking of checking this place out , get takeout .
and this place went downhill in quality and service over the last _num_ years .
it 's generally crowded with rushed service and the food has yet to impress .
after sitting down our drink order was promptly taken and filled .
it was not .
the sushi was c grade .
passable but not anything i would return for .
the miso soup had iceberg lettuce in it .
first , bad service .
waiter did not bring us a bread .
order was slow .
sushi quality was bad .
yakisoba noodle was burned .
husband had chicken parm .
is that my noodles were not good !
might be for some people , but it 's not for me .
i 've driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles .
wth was going on .
honestly , i probably wo n't be going back .
it was n't bad , just was n't special .
i ordered the chicken pad tai - thinking it would be a safe bet .
also - the food was very bland .
not a hint of kick to it at all .
however , the service was less than stellar .
there were just _num_ of us and _num_ dishes between us .
i can not believe so many other reviews were soooo positive .
it was not the best combination to say the least .
there was hardly any miso in the soup .
an insult to the patron of the restaurant .
how lazy can this restaurant get !
this one is not as bad as some other asian fusion restaurant .
the guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water !
i know it is sealed but , really ?
i saw _num_ sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself .
not impressed at all .
what a waste of my precious hard earned money .
this is a place that requires much better management and service .
( after waiting for _num_ hr , this is what we got ?
turned out that was a big mistake .
the other one was even worse .
i wo n't recommend this restaurant to anyone .
horrible service .
barely acknowledged when you first walked in .
will not come again .
i always substitute rice noodles , never had an issue .
as much as i love their food , they have lost a customer .
this was our 3rd visit to cherry blossom .
we 'll , we have made the decision it 's not that great .
but , its either that or loose more customers due your very bad service .
avoid avoid avoid .
service was terrible and food was below average .
the salmon sashimi was not good .
i ca n't remember when i have ever left fried calamari on my plate .
i will avoid in the future or at least these menu items .
this was my first time visiting cherry blossom noodle cafe .
i really wanted noodles , ie a noodle bar .
the food was average , but it was the service that left me unimpressed .
the waiter was short and was very impersonal .
there were only two other tables being served too .
he 'd refill our drinks and was on the ball .
but the employee culture is greatly lacking .
bread was basic bread , nothing special .
first , the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket .
am i wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch ?
that 's why i spend money in a restaurant !
lots of supermarket stuff , at a premium price .
sorry , that 's not why i go to a restaurant .
so why did i even bother trying this place ?
as someone else said , there 's really no place to wait .
it was very busy .
this is not the first time it 's happened .
this was one of the few times yelp has led us wrong .
unfortunately , it was downhill from the point we got our food .
the sushi all tasted fishy .
the worst experience i 've ever had .
ridiculous .
so disappointing .
was craving sushi and decided to give this place a try .
ordered the sushi combo , added a miso soup and bowl of steamed rice .
waited forever to get a refill for my drink forever .
this place should get a big fat no stars from me .
the waiter is rude and really just horrible ( the make waiter ) .
they were not wrapped properly and just fell apart !
they also serve italian food , kind of weird .
its not the typical hole in the wall feel .
got the pad thai and added chicken .
i immediately stopped eating , finished my beer and left .
rude .
rude .
rude .
at a table for one , i ordered a squid salad and three rolls .
, and replied , `` i 'm sure gon na try to ! ''
to which she argued , `` but you are so thin ! ''
ridiculous .
i am so disappointed and insulted .
japanese and italian ?
service : place was packed and service was extra slow .
i probably wont b back .
surprised with all the yelp reviews ... disappointed .
one would think that the owners would at least look at the reviews .
is there no manager !
on the downside , the service still was horrible in every way .
so , no good news here .
avoid .
very rude service .
the place was totally empty .
the only other customer in the place was leaving .
i have to sit in the back where i could smell the bathrooms .
unbelievable over _num_ empty tables and i was told i have to sit there .
i then immediately walked out !
very disappointed !
for a well seasoned asian food eater like myself , this place fails .
i 've had the smoked salmon ramen and the udon stir fry .
neither were very good .
ramen was too salty and the udon was bland .
the sushi is about par with the grocery stores .
my biggest gripe is the terribly slow service !
he did n't bother to check on the status of our food .
if you have time to wait for mediocre food -- be my guest !
a shame .
i decided to stop in for lunch since i now work in the area .
he apologized and tried to make it better .
i just was speechless at this point .
i will be actually calling and filing a formal complaint as this was unacceptable .
i will be back but refuse to sit in his section ... ever !
i 've been craving ramen and this seemed like a sure bet .
i left with utter disappointment .
he even rushed our forgotten to-go drink as we got to our car .
nope , not the case at all !
extremely rude !
it does n't make any sense at all .
this is my first yelp review ever .
it 's rather unfortunate it had to be a negative one .
if you want nigiri sushi or sashimi , try hiro sushi .
the worst place i have ever been too .
this place is nasty , horrible customer service and small .
not impressed with the ambience or menu .
food is about average , service is too bad .
we had dinner tonight and tried several dishes .
the rice was a little hard .
the vegetables were cut too thin and ended up overcooked .
the pad that had no flavor and the meat was way overcooked .
disappointing .
there was very little people inside the restaurant as we arrived around 2pm .
this strawberry cheesecake that was more like a mousse filling than cheesecake .
the side salad that came with it was wilted and boring .
i felt like i was eating a spicy spaghetti soup .
the meal just looked thrown together and not appealing to the eye .
i do n't think i 'll be back ... maybe for the dessert counter .
however , the service was really bad .
so i do n't understand why it took so long .
it took _num_ mins to get my menus .
the staffs were unfriendly and gave off weird vibes .
maybe the food is fine but obvious problems with the service .
terrible service and overrated ramen and dessert .
dessert was only good looking but tasted so-so .
can not believe the male server is still there .
the server neither explained the menu nor gave me any suggestion directly .
i wish there was a way to give zero stars .
he was extremely unpleasant and was not willing to explain anything to me .
he was rushing me and was extremely rude .
udon soup as did my co worker .
bad service and bad food .
no thanks .
parking sucks .
this place is pretty amazing !
could n't resist !
the lighting is dim for a restaurant and the sitting are has wooden tables .
soon as i walked in a was greeted and sat .
she just walked away and never came back .
i am not happy with the customer service at all .
the food is mediocre and not worth coming back !
decided to try this noodle cafe and was highly disappointed !
they have italian pastas and then they have their noodle options which were confusing .
no pictures of the noodles but minimum description .
i do n't like katsu .
had i known i would have not ordered this entree .
the curry alone was not appetizing .
my food was lukewarm if even warm .
the only good thing about my food was the rice .
my plate looked as if i did n't even touch it .
horrible service !
this time around , yakisoba was super oily and bland .
the food is awsome .
i am extremely disappointed by the customer service provided by this office .
absolutely do not recommend this doctor or his staff .
you guys are what gives the health care industry a bad reputation .
i returned the next morning to return both items as my camera was stolen .
i lost $ _num_ on a $ _num_ purchase .
i strongly caution you to read their policies before buying anything .
they do n't .
no one asked if i needed help when i came in .
my experience was not pleasant .
they are always soo helpful and they have way more stuff .
ca n't say the same for this place .
no online ability to take money .
wo n't take credit cards over the phone .
wo n't take american express .
do n't know how this store stays in business .
we called ahead to your store and inquired if you had one .
we had _num_ minutes to travel _num_ miles .
he could have cared less .
i wish your business luck for the future .
the price of the lens is $ _num_ retail .
do n't tell me you only make $ _num_ on a lens sale .
this place is the absolute worst .
i would much rather go to best buy or use amazon .
this telephone call occurred on november _num_ , _num_ at approximately 6:00 pm .
she then hung up on me .
no kidding .
everyone else at the club was friendly , helpful , and welcoming .
but this in no way excuses her complete lack of professionalism .
do n't bother coming here .
the staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes .
mexican pizza was extremely gross .
do n't go at night terrible service .
big taco bell fan just not this location .
but this is ridiculous .
my boyfriend left and realized they short changed him by $ _num_ .
he drove away and had to come back for his money .
they did n't turn off the lights or anything to signal it was closing .
to the empty kitchen .
she opened the window and gave us the missing food .
horrible .
totally disgusted .
out of beans , beef , and chicken .
what the hell is the assistant manager doing all day ?
what a poorly ran establishment .
and the manager is too lazy and rude to deal with the problems !
i was having some brake trouble last week .
the buttons were off of it .
no one apologized still for it .
it this does n't deter you from here i do n't know what will .
it ended up taking three hours as they waited for a part .
the car works great but the customer service left much to be desired .
they do n't deserve it !
saved myself $ _num_ .
the 7th st location is a scam shack .
$ _num_ in tax ?
i suppose your $ _num_ brake special already includes the coupon .
for all of you , please be warned .
i took it into a repair shop and spent over _num_ dollars in repairs .
total rip off !
i genuinely cant believe people can be that dishonest !
if i could , i would give this place _num_ stars .
this tells me they either did not listen to me or did not care .
either way , strike _num_ of many .
no phone call from them after the initial assessment at 2pm .
it was not done .
this part that should take _num_ minutes once received took over _num_ hours .
fast forward _num_ more hours and they have not arrived .
later that night the manager blows up my phone to get paid of course .
i honestly have never received such terrible service in my life .
i was certainly wrong .
it seems the corporate office does n't even care about their customers .
you have been warned .
woke up early on my day off to make an 8am appointment .
11am i called for update .
1pm i called for update , they say another hour !
however , i had my first frustrating experience .
they do n't , ca n't or wo n't answer questions via email !
`` it 's ok , if you ca n't afford a cadillac . ''
this is horrible business .
one thing is for sure , the owners will read about it .
i sincerely apologize for what happened last night .
service scam alert !
they told me both where fine and that i had been lied to .
i did so for today , calling in the morning for a 1:30 appointment .
it 's been over _num_ hours ?
i go and let him know what 's my truck doing there ?
we took it back & they said nothing was wrong with them .
we do not buy our cars here i am just here for a recall .
normally we 're down the street at camelback toyota .
well they must have spoiled us there because the service here sucks .
neat looking place , terrible customer service .
so were waiting and he never shows up to greet us .
so they kept my car all day with no warning .
ultimately , they want to keep my car over night .
i am so upset at the poor customer service i received .
( so extremely rude ! )
i will not be going back !
i bought the filter for $ _num_ at autozone and installed it myself .
no exaggeration on that !
the first repair was n't even the problem .
the next step would be a class action case .
look below to see the final decision offered to us by gm .
they have referred to our issue as `` unexpected '' engine problems .
apparently this is a problem that many of this year and model have had .
that 's not unexpected then on the part of gm .
terrible service for repairs .
it gets worse .
let me repeat that , the terrible repairs were done in march .
none of these to the best of my knowledge exist on my vehicle .
sadly , it appears things have changed since i was a child .
once he left we were unsure of what he actually said .
the escargot came and did not taste as great as i had remembered .
the salad had more then enough dressing , luckily the dressing was good .
the plate looked very plain with items not being placed in any nice manner .
the halibut was slightly over cooked and did not have much flavor .
it was difficult to speak to one another over the many other loud conversations .
overall , i would not return to this restaurant nor recommend it .
he then proceeded to take the other tables ' orders .
on the way to a much nicer and hospitable establishment .
i had never been so offended in my life .
i could not hear any more .
funky house salad with a creamy ranch ( ? )
dressing and one slice of bad hot house tomato .
white french baguette bread and butter was plentiful , thank god .
the stuffed mushroom appetizer was bland and my veal entre was drowned in sauce .
the service was _num_ star , i 'll give them that .
i could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons .
the fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it .
my husband had a pasta with italian sausage and chicken in a marinara sauce .
the chunks of canned tomatoes were unappetizing .
first time but never again !
disgusting food , terrible service .
things started poorly .
the flavor of the sea bass was lost in the tomatoes .
yes the prices are very reasonable but the food and ambiance are nothing special .
food is adequate but not authentic .
ok , this is entirely sad .
but , not this new year 's eve .
bread , butter , olive oil ?
here 's my problem .
not tonight and that 's sincerely sad .
not up to their par .
it smells like mold & cleaner gone wrong .
not appetizing !
even if your family has eaten here for _num_ years .
no explanation .
no apology .
not a pleasant experience after the drive .
when i inquired , debbie was curt to say the least .
later called me and told me the part `` was on back order ! ''
why oh why would we want to do business with them in the future ?
i have never been treated so bad .
i will not use them ever again .
now , most people know insurance only covers rentals for _num_ days .
poor customer service all the way around !
instead , they had it for _num_ days .
very unprofessional , and i will never bring them my business again .
very rude and very unpleasant & very unprofessional !
those two women should n't even have a job !
i would never recommend this collision center to anyone .
not sure what planet they are on but both should not have a job .
constant ignored emails and calls with the excuses of a school grade child .
both cupcakes were made from a mix .
neither my husband nor i cared for it .
the rye bread barely tasted of rye , although it had a decent texture .
i was appalled that i had to `` prove '' it was bad .
i could not believe this man actually tasted the cake .
this just set me off .
these little bakeries then wonder why they have to close their doors .
sound 's good does n't it .
it 's been that way for sometime and is n't getting any better .
the result is for the most part i tend to avoid the place .
i 'll spend my money there .
another reason not to go there is not their fault .
it 's rather sad to have to write a review like this .
says it 's kosher , but apparently only sometimes .
i arrived and was met at the door by the sign , `` sorry .
so i went inside , wondering if it was an april fool 's joke .
they could not help me .
no yummy kosher flourless chocolate cake would be in my immediate future .
they were tasteless ... everything is the same tasteless flavor .
everything else leaves me flat .
if she would let me use my card .
when i went in , there was a guy behind the counter .
it was really uncomfortable ... .
she just stared at me .
so , i purchased _num_ pastries and got out .
i walked in and looked at the cases .
i wish i could like the idea of going there .
so , here 's a run down .
puff pastry was flavorless .
however , i did like the service !
i brought _num_ bagels to my students and we found them to be stale .
that meant i was going to miss my little sister 's baby shower !
: ( that made me incredibly sad .
holy mary , mother of god , was i dead wrong about that .
i have never cried so hard in my life !
seriously , i was a wreck .
after a recent visit , i still have no idea .
honestly , it 's just not any good .
and my loaf of `` fresh sourdough '' was stale and completely tasteless .
eh ... .
the pour was okay , i 've had better elsewhere for the same price .
not horrible but i doubt i 'll be back .
i do not like saturdays here .
like , under _num_ young .
did i get the word rude in there ?
nick does n't work on saturdays .
it 's just crap .
those guys you were hanging all over were n't even interested in you either .
they were just too drunk to care .
my gay neighbor took me here for afternoon cocktails on a sat .
the bartender was unfriendly and the bloody mary had no alcohol .
gross !
not true and not cool .
i informed them and all i got was sorry .
if you are `` drunk and annoying '' do not come here !
no freaking way !
all in all , fuck that place .
this place is not a local dive bar .
the employees do not care about anyone who lives in the neighborhood .
our experience here was crappy .
but the service and attitude of this bartender was horrendous .
i ca n't believe she has a job there .
then she says `` why is n't he answering me then !
like a damn toddler screaming for attention , that 's what she sounded like .
she just did n't deserve anything .
unless there is another and nicer bartender on duty .
the missing _num_ stars .
everything is dirty , this place needs a deep clean .
low key we could have hopped the bar , grabbed our cards and left .
this guy is ridiculous and does not deserve anybody 's money .
$ _num_ to have a starter motor and fan put in .
learn from my mistake , and stay away .
$ _num_ down the drain .
slow .
the dealership was less than this repair shop .
he owns the retail shop too , so skip that as well .
i have not had a leak in over _num_ weeks since the replacement .
and advised me with what i needed help with .
she later had a man talk to me that was just as condescending .
left the place feeling like i did n't get what i wanted .
you know i am a paying customer too .
what a horrible place to get service work done .
place is a total rip off i will never go again .
when i went to use it the next week it still did n't work .
i repeat do not !
my little brother was placed here and it is atrocious !
apparently the left hand does n't know what the right hand is doing .
the food is horrible and does not fit with any type of dietary needs .
i would n't feed that to my dog .
i can not stress enough about not sending your loved ones to this facility .
rude lazy people who do n't care .
contrary to what others posted the inside of the building did not stink .
none of the food i saw looked appetizing .
it 's dirty and there are roaches , bugs crawling on the walls .
the staff also does not do nearly enough for the people staying there .
it was so noisy too and smelled like animals !
why are you using email if you are n't going to check for responses ?
thanks but no thanks , i left .
i would not recommend them to anyone .
i first went to this dermatologist years ago and it was a so-so experience .
i will not be returning .
i never even saw a doctor here , something i find strange .
i would never go back again .
the wait time for my appointment was long .
the office sent over my rx to my local cvs .
and nothing .
would not recommend this office to anyone .
my appointment lasted about less than _num_ minutes and was not very thorough .
complete waste of my money .
if u could give _num_ stars i totally would .
this is n't a facility that i would ever visit again !
wow , this has been the worst experience and care ever .
it turned out that they do n't take my insurance .
so i had to leave and wait for the referral to be fixed .
wow , what an annoying experience !
she 's _num_ years old and this guy is man handling her .
the office is old and seems dingy and dirty .
i would not recommend this place to my worst enemy .
office management needs to step in and fix asap !
i can tell you staff is not pleasant at all !
i expected to have a paper gown in place for my exam .
bottom line - an awful experience .
never again will i visit this office again .
they did n't lose or damage my clothes and they all came back fine .
however , i certainly was n't blown away with the customer service .
the parking situation also sucks .
i took _num_ coats in to be altered .
and not that good .
once again the reception person was not only unfriendly , but downright rude .
but when i pick up my shirts they 're all folded up and boxed .
no word to me that they tried and could n't get them out .
they just pressed them into the fabric more and sent me on my way .
but i wo n't be back for a while if ever .
if its friday , hey , maybe we should have more than _num_ barbers .
however , i 've had two miserable haircuts in a row .
he could not help me with that .
in any case , i do n't think i will return .
needless to say , my hopes were let down .
this is not a very hard haircut , mind you .
the whole time , i was faced away from the mirror .
i am still left with cut marks _num_ days later .
i beg any of you that is reading this review to avoid this shop .
_num_ ) appointments kept on time .
_num_ ) warm towel and massage .
whatever you do , dont give them your personal information .
this place has changed so much and not in a good way .
all i can say is thank god my hair can grow back .
me almost two hundred for an oil change and adding coolant .
there is nothing special about this place .
the conversation was totally inappropriate and forced us to eat outside .
this is one cheap owner .
poor value , ok quality .
nothing special , to be honest .
sadly , sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns .
i know why i have not ever stopped in ... .
what a disappointment !
it was firm , but not dry , and full of flavor .
now , it 's bland and tasteless .
no more .
the selection is n't what it was .
waiting _num_ minutes for a drink however is too long .
so , clearly the musician 's make the night .
our night was not so hot .
the neighborhood is questionable .
the entrance is not obvious , the bar and the service are not inviting .
not worth it .
`` umm ... i 'm not sure can you hold ? ''
`` dude , i just said _num_ . ''
a _num_ , _num_ or _num_ series ? ''
`` dude , i have no freakin ' clue what size engine it is .
+ previously mentioned worker was friendly .
- $ _num_ for oil , tire rotation , air filter .
_num_ minutes from the time i pulled up till the time i left .
i 'll be asking for my money back this time .
first and last time i wo n't be returning .
after all i am the customer and i was not satisfied at all .
( issues , lost time , money and gas i lost . )
rating _num_ stars only for the cabinet quality and resolution work .
the installation was certainly sub par , not on time .
the finished products were poorly executed in places ( cabinet doors off center ) .
i tried to get that corrected , but no response came through .
not a word was mentioned about it from them , not a question !
they are so ignorant !
other than that , camelback vw is as sleazy as they come .
yeah i know sounds like most any used car sales operation in phoenix .
tell us the car price + tax , fees and registration .
they had taken up yet another night and this offer just plain sucked .
that 's when we walked for the last time .
simply did n't trust them .
do not buy a car from this place !
the all time worst experience i ever had with an auto dealer .
spread the word about this horrible excuse for a business .
no customer service at all .
had an issue purchasing a vw back in _num_ .
i 'm not having to take my issue to the better business bureau .
they 're just not worth this much hassle .
i totally get all the bad reviews from these guys .
my purchase experience was just o.k .
once you buy a car there , the customer service is over .
it 's ridiculous .
if you are looking to buy a car do n't go here .
it amazed me how many times they would overlook things during maintenance .
but i would not recommend camelback .
my salesman was marty , who was very helpful .
long story short i took it back and got my audi back .
i leave the lot get into traffic and this car will not move .
barry , my salesperson , was wonderful .
he first showed us this car in awful condition .
the manager flat out told us to buy the car or to leave .
i 've never been treated this poorly at a dealership in my life .
i had cash to buy a car and opted to go elsewhere .
went through all the standard bs that buying a new car comes with .
everything went downhill from there .
ca n't recommend highly enough that you avoid these guys at all costs .
first , our salesman mario seemed irritated to have to be working at all .
_num_ weeks sitting on the lot in less than clean condition ?
but ultimately i decided to buy , and get financing through vw credit .
while i was doing the paperwork , i was told the car being detailed .
it appeared that they they just gave it a quick wipe down and vacuum .
i brought the car back the next day and the customer service was horrible .
when i got the car back , they had n't done anything to it .
i waited _num_ hours for nothing .
finally the paperwork arrived and all was resolved .
moral of the story : do n't waste your time with camelback vw .
i drive over _num_ miles to see this car .
now one was there , they tried the old bait and switch on me !
why would i want to work with anyone who flat out lied to me ?
stay far away from this place ... .
the sales experience was fine , but this dealership does not respect your privacy .
contacted them through the internet , no response .
called the general manager , did n't receive a call back .
low miles , great price , and in amazing shape .
i ask for the warranty to be removed , only to be told no .
i get my tires replaced , only to hear a new noise yesterday .
this time i was quoted $ _num_ !
oh my gosh what a horrible nightmare this has been .
avoid .
they should move the waiting room away from the sales floor area .
if i did n't have lifetime oil changes i probably would n't come back .
i ran out of gas almost immediately after the fuel light turned on .
unbelievable .
what a bunch of , well , use your favorite word .
avoid this place at all cost !
take it from me avoid this place !
this is the worse car i have ever owned !
why did n't i check it out at first ?
all my repairs were not covered by the basic _num_ months warranty .
these guys will rip you off !
the buying experience with any dealership , i found it to be as expected .
the local dealership never responded to my complaint .
my experience is far too long to write on here .
i have been lied to and taken advantage of on more than one occasion .
of i could return my truck and cut all ties , i would .
my finance advisor had me come back and sign my contract four times !
not sure where to begin but i 'll give my experiences .
all i got was `` i made a mistake '' .
right then i knew they were liars and flat out dishonest .
think twice before servicing your car at camelback vw !
the grand total was $ _num_ !
total repair is less than $ _num_ .
worst ever .
if i could give a negative star i would .
one of the worst vehicle purchase experiences ever .
terrible .
terrible dealership !
there is a reason why they only have _num_ stars !
we also have had bad experiences with the sales department since .
do not let these people get your contact details .
terrible dealership !
there is a reason why they only have _num_ stars !
terrible dealership !
there is a reason why they only have _num_ stars !
i get here today and no loaner .
`` i 'm not interested in financing i have my loan . ''
`` no i do n't want a $ _num_ car payment . ''
ridiculous . )
i do n't think an intelligent word came out of her mouth .
we could see straight through this woman 's fake demeanor .
shame on you camelback vw .
instead of saying , `` no , '' he just hung up on me .
big mistake .
it is a big dealership so looks very trusting .
they made up the 2nd time though .
_num_ months later i was stranded the battery died .
not holding my breath on this place .
it 's been two days , and they still have n't called me .
i unfortunately got a car from this place !
never , ever give these people your contact information .
you get the point - do n't wait , buy now at any cost !
oh no - that price did n't include dealer fees !
not _num_ months .
not $ _num_ a month as advertised on their own website .
they would n't let me test drive the car .
they would n't honor the advertised deal .
do n't walk - run - from this dealership !
i have purchased _num_ cars from camelback vw and had good experiences .
she did not see a problem .
they gave excuse after excuse as to why it was a low trade in .
this place is truly the worst place to buy from .
i will never use them again because they do not do what they say .
it was the most horrible experience i have ever been through .
being so sick of arguing and speaking with this company i just agreed .
i will never purchase a vw again .
i informed him that i was the original owner of the auto .
he told me to contact camelback vw to figure this out .
this is the worst dealer ever .
do n't buy your car here .
one star does n't give justice to how shady these people are .
they called to tell me the bank would not approve me .
i would n't refer my enemy to this dealership .
get ready for more business vw north scottsdale .
i was a bmw customer for over _num_ years .
it drives like a _num_ series .
the service warranty offered by bmw however leaves vw in the dust !
strike _num_ !
strike _num_ !
so they are fixing that too , so hear i sit for _num_ hours !
strike _num_ !
it was torture .
just disappointing that the communication is n't better when the dr. is backed up .
they have a good selection , we just felt really unwelcome .
not cool .
not the kind of experience i expected of a place geared to all ages .
i was disappointed to say the least .
i do not recommend this store due to the way the staff treats people .
the staff need some serious training on customer service .
a walgreens with no liquor ?
seems like they already lost their spirit .
they do n't care about marketing .
it was horrible .
i could 've had the same experience watching it on my ipad .
do not waste your hard earned money .
i walked in and there was nobody in the lobby and two gentlemen working .
then i told him i would like to get an oil change .
three of the worst dollars i 've ever spent .
bad idea .
the chips were soggy and no crunch to any of them at all .
i 've had better and it could be spicier .
my $ _num_ could have been better spent at taco bell tonight .
i ordered a bean and cheese burrito for $ _num_ .
you 're _num_ % not the only burrito in central phoenix .
unbelievably expensive and very misleading the way they explain things !
no frills .
we walked out paying nearly $ _num_ .
lisa contacted me directly to discuss our experience .
bringing our own case could have saved us a few hundred dollars !
stay away from this installer .
maybe their reviews were closed because they were bad .
but i 'm glad i went for comparison shopping .
so , i made an appointment for last saturday to check it out .
( all of the dresses i chose were under $ _num_ . )
the assistant mgr was the nasty girl ever .
she made my bridesmaids feel unwelcome and she was very rude to me .
they just need better staffing .
service = crap .
was told it 'd be there in _num_ weeks .
_num_ weeks later , i call , am told it could take _num_ weeks .
worst service ever .
they were rude , unprofessional and i will never recommend them .
the owner is missing , and the phone is not working .
horrible customer service .
would not recommended this place .
i 've used the shuttle service often to get to and from work .
german auto said i needed to replace my battery .
i wont be returning to german auto unfortunately .
not even a sorry when i arrived the next day .
very rude and horrible customer service .
if i was the owner of this shop i would fire that employee immediately .
very disgusted with their customer service .
i work up the street and stop here one or twice a week .
be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now .
not very appetizing , but i 'm willing to give any place a chance .
worst fried ice cream we 've ever had !
bad .
very bad .
ordered a combo : sour cream enchilada , taco and tostada .
this place has been around forever , but i ca n't really understand why .
the restaurant is run down .
there are many better options for mexican food around this area .
they were basically corn tortillas with some shredded cheddar cheese melted on top .
check yelp first , no matter how good a deal it seems .
sadly , we found jordan 's .
horrible .
sadly , we did n't have any salsa to put on it .
the visit in november is likely my last .
the service was terrible .
it was edible , but not great .
i am being utterly polite by giving this place one star .
you 've been warned .
outdated , dingy , dining space and help .
avoid it !
sadly nostalgia does n't make the food here any less bland .
what we got was gray meat , with not one ounce of seasoning .
but saw quickly that we would not be buying that story .
this is what happens when you have uninspired people making food .
too sad .
i 've been driving past this place for quite some time .
the service was typical of what you would typically expect from such a restaurant .
my wife and i both the green corn tamales w/ beans .
to be fair , the tamale was ok .
the most disappointing part of the meal was the salsa .
by far the worst salsa i 've ever had !
i really hate giving this _num_ stars .
my _num_ cents !
i 'm not exactly sure .
i ordered a chicken burro enchilada style .
the enchilada sauce topping was also quite flavorless .
just do n't eat here .
just ca n't seem to find anything positive to say about this place .
this place was absolutely terrible .
at least there 's an excuse for food being bad when it 's cold .
my _num_ minute interaction was enough .
my tostada on the other hand was good .
other than that , it was an ok meal .
never rated a place this low before .
the menus came with dried up food on mine .
they eventually came and brought us typical chips and awful salsa .
it tasted a little like flavored tomato paste as well .
he asked what kind of sauce , we said green but on the side .
went in at _num_ ; _num_ for an early dinner .
waited _num_ minutes , and no one came to seat me .
i was disappointed to say the least in the food and the cost .
menu was hard to follow .
chips were good .
was sadly disappointed .
very uncomfortable .
it 's living hell .
am i not also a paying customer that also had an appointment ?
should n't you finish my car before starting work on a different car ?
i 'm sure it was probably my neighbor who was calling in the complaints .
never did anything wrong to this woman .
do n't waste your time .
i know exactly what i want to make i just need some assistance .
i explained i did n't want a class just some assistance .
four times she repeated herself regarding her class .
however i ca n't seem to give them my money .
i 'm solely giving this place _num_ stars due to the selection of wigs .
i almost walked out .
i could not have been more annoyed .
i am giving this business one star due to the poor customer service .
there was no compassion and advise from the sales clerk .
it was definitely not hot enough .
want to piss me off ?
not last night , not today and certainly not tomorrow .
i have been wanting to have americanized chinese for a week or so .
after driving up 7th st .
definitely cheap , however not worth more .
the dining area smelled like a bait shop , the bathrooms smelled even worse .
i was quickly greeted , though , and directed to my seat .
my drink order was taken before i even sat down , which was nice .
not exactly appetizing .
why _num_ stars , then ?
bad .
out of business on april _num_ , _num_ .
gave us a ridiculous quote on a simple solution .
then tried charging us _num_ $ just to diagnose the issue .
they do n't deserve _num_ star !
i usually do n't write reviews but my experience here was horrible .
i was not pleased .
which was very unprofessional .
inspect your purchase while you are still on site .
i get better service at home depot .
not impressed .
me : ok , can you substitute noodles for rice , please ?
now i can see why the employee was so confused .
there was no sauce in my rice bowl .
it was just chicken , rice , egg , and green onions .
now it is plain dirty .
their miso soup was cold and spoiled .
i would never visit this location again .
even for fast casual japanese food , it sucked .
it was like hospital cafeteria veggies .
it was not worth $ _num_ or whatever the price .
one of the worse meals i can remember having .
i would not recommend .
i called in my order , the meals were ready when i got there .
terrible lunch service .
ordered at the counter instead and spent _num_ minutes waiting for the food .
ridiculous .
menu is reduced and new people are running the show .
last four times i came for lunch , it was awful !
used to be a favorite lunch place , but not anymore .
sadly , the food quality and flavor has left this location .
why ca n't i stop eating this delicious food ? '
this is no longer a problem .
it seems that most of my meal could easily be tossed aside .
wow ... this place has horrible customer service !
i will not return here .
tokyo express was the place to go in phoenix for teriyaki chicken years ago .
why and how can you ruin a place like this ?
beware , in my opinion there are better places out there for japanese food .
do n't bother .
worst asian food i 've ever had - nothing asian about except the name .
they were bland , the beef looks like and has a texture of pork .
our teriyaki chicken was dry and the wait was long .
the car has not felt remotely right since it was in their hands .
they seem far more on top of things .
added more then $ _num_ to my final bill which is not the issue .
very disappointing .
no lox for me .
i 've given it about _num_ chances now .
the service is terrible , at least for take-out .
wish it could have been scott 's .
i 'm sorry .
this is the first time i 've been disappointed .
let me explain the _num_ star ... .
why yes , it was your friendly neighborhood roach !
too bad .
most likely will not be back .
used to come by once or twice a month for lunch .
the last time i was here was some time in _num_ .
the service was bad .
and then leaves .
i did n't know what i wanted , so i said , water .
the sandwich was dry .
it did n't have mayo or mustard on it .
i ordered `` french fries '' , but they were more like country potatoes .
severely disappointed .
$ _num_ ... for two crappy sandwiches , and some under cooked potatoes .
really horrible , all the way around .
the soup was also cold .
this was bitter and not smooth .
unpleasant .
you got ta be kidding me .
disgusting .
meatloaf was a friggin ' nightmare .
not sliced from a loaf , but a patty that was baked .
super well done , chewy crap .
carrots were overcooked ; mashed potatoes were ordinary .
my bill was $ _num_ .
with tip , $ _num_ .
service was polite , but a little slow .
i am so angry that i paid for this crap .
this is the second worst meal i 've ever paid for in my life .
i 'm _num_ .
very , very bad restaurant .
ugh .
however ... .
i only had $ _num_ ( only ? )
left the waitress $ _num_ .
it was terribly salty , and not much peppercorn taste .
bread size is the same as an ordinary square loaf of sandwich bread .
not coming back to this place .
speaking of the food , it was pretty terrible .
honestly , i would have rather eaten at home .
i 'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got .
dirty and filthy , food is awful , place filled with bugs and roaches .
then no one washed the table !
gross !
bad food bad service greasy matzo ball soup .
skip this dump .
i literally took one bite and left it was so bad .
these people were so unbelievably rude to me .
i 've been wanting to try scott 's for years .
during the end of the lunch rush scott 's was empty .
ignoring these details was a poor choice on my part .
there were chicken bones in my soup .
it was not prepared to go .
the pickles were the only bright spot of the meal .
by this point i was so over it i just wanted to leave .
six hours later my stomach is upset .
this morning , my wife , daughter and i walked there for brunch .
we sat out side , ordered and ate .
the food was average , and a bit overpriced .
the place was a little dirty .
the food is forgettable and the service , was beyond description .
living in the neighborhood , i 've been to scott 's maybe three times .
you would think that you get your sandwich wrapped in gold leaf .
scott 's does not give me any reason to return .
the service is atrocious .
i once stood at the counter for almost _num_ minutes before being acknowledged .
disappointing deli .
my daughter would n't even eat it .
the breakfast was gross .
waited _num_ minutes for basic breakfast .
should have just come in for a bagel and probably would have been satisfied .
there sub should be priced at _num_ tops .
their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt .
these people were so unbelievably rude to me .
ordered takeout for lunch at work .
so today , i was feeling horrible .
service was kind of slow , but friendly .
it was n't worth my lunch hour .
really gross !
-- small , hard , and with an off taste .
deli sandwiches were ok.
the corned beef was wonderful but so overcooked in my scramble .
tough little bits of meat in the way overcooked eggs .
i had to add salt and pepper and it was still tough and bland .
the bagel was over toasted and tough .
overall , we will not come back and feel so sad .
not that there 's anything wrong with that , but it felt strange .
service was adequate , but a bit slow .
this was awful ; just awful .
it was obvious her english was limited .
i should have just got up and walked out .
i realized she had n't asked my what kind of bread i wanted .
she finally came around and said , `` sorry they 're so slow . ''
i could barely find it .
the grilled onion was inedible .
the pastrami was sky high but tough and not juicy .
with a drink my bill came to $ _num_ .
wo n't go back .
this place is not good at all .
then she brought it without sour cream .
the pastrami was literally flavorless .
the only good thing we had was the potato pancake .
owner yelling at employees in front of customers !
bad , bad , bad .
i would never try this place .
it was dirty as well .
i was tired of waiting and went to the counter to leave .
waited another _num_ minutes at the register for them to get my ticket .
otherwise , it wo n't do well .
i wo n't be back .
awful place not the same .
i bought a breakfast burrito and a vegetable omelet and paid $ _num_ .
just really strange customer service -- almost like they did n't want the business .
i will not be going back to them anytime soon .
even bad pizza is n't half bad .
zero , and i mean zero flavor in this pizza .
and where in the heck do you find flavorless pepperoni ?
terrible !
pizza was below average .
i usually come during the day time to avoid the candle light atmosphere .
pizza still good but anything else is boring like the music .
boring should n't be loud .
good pizza , lousy service !
what a mistake .
we sat for over _num_ minutes and no service .
hence the two star rating .
there was n't anything bad about the place .
oh , ok , stupid me .
i give the place _num_ stars for an ok cheese pizza .
it was n't the worse pizza but it was mediocre at best .
she did n't offer to take anything off the bill and made .
she clearly has no idea what it means to be a server .
the crust was tasteless and soggy like wet cardboard .
i 'm so disappointed .
i am confused about all the hype .
my order came out to $ _num_ .
$ _num_ per wing ?
the wings were soggy on the outside , and over cooked on the inside .
what a waste of time , and money .
it was the most tasteless thing i 've ever eaten .
too bad , i wanted to like this place .
i will not be returning here anytime soon .
overall rating _num_ out of _num_ .
it was hot in there .
i am very disappointed to say the least !
i ordered fried zucchini sticks which were pretty good !
i 'm glad i just did n't order a full pizza .
no soda came and the wings were rock hard .
such a waste of money .
i will not be returning .
i had split a spinach salad with _num_ medium wings .
they were tiny wings and the sauce was just too watery and not great .
i picked pieces to eat , but threw much of it away .
undercooked noodles in the spaghetti .
the meatballs in the spaghetti were bland and overcooked .
the spaghetti was terrible , it had a weird taste to it !
no effort !
i do n't know why this place has _num_ stars .
pizza hell !
the dough was not too good , not too bad .
it took them _num_ minutes to complete our order .
the wait was too long !
i did n't even get everything i ordered .
service was horrible .
the place was empty !
our hostess set us down in the main dining room .
_num_ minutes later our waiter arrived and took our order .
he had our table confused with someone else .
the pizza was just basic pizza .
employees forgot to place order and all the could do was say sorry .
talk to several employees and no one seem to know what was going on .
worst experience ordering pizza .
the chicken was more of a chicken patty or chicken nugget type of texture !
the frys and the wings were also noticeably from a bag .
our waiter is attentive at first but things slowly grew worse and worse .
this was one of the worst experiences i 've ever had at a restaurant .
all i asked for was actual cheese and not vegan cheese .
wrong , i thought the server 's head was about to pop off .
then he proceeds to bring out my actual sandwich with a side of fries .
i paid for my salad and my wine because that 's all i ate .
it was n't a busy night and i was not being unreasonable .
i visited this establishment for a take out pizza experience .
i walked in to an environment that was not well lit .
i waited at the counter ... no one was around .
i waited some more ... no one was around .
lack of quality .
if you like pizza and respect yourself then do not go .
raise your hands high turn around and walk away .
sorry , not sorry .
4th gluten free pizza - do not order this option .
4th time is not and nor will be the charm for these options .
but i was n't impressed .
thin crust pizza was horrible .
ca n't eat and look at that .
horrible service .
they lost a customer as a result of the lack of good customer service .
however , the customer service is terrible .
but this time around , it was not great .
she never apologized .
we live _num_ minutes away .
i do n't need to know how you feel about your staff .
um , its _num_ right ?
my buddy had told me they had awesome sandwiches as well .
the sandwich itself was forgettable .
and when we get the bill i notice nothing was comped .
nothing done to make it right .
our waiter had no personality and was invisible most of the time .
thin crust pepperoni was very blah .
no interest at all in eating it - not worth the calories .
i 'm quite annoyed that i wasted $ _num_ for dinner tonight .
bad customer service + bad food = fail !
after being seated , we orders drinks and an app .
jalapeo peppers were average at best .
it was really just average food with not so great service .
needless to say we left as soon as we finished our drinks .
i was totally embarrassed .
i 'm not really a fan .
a few years back i was treated with horrible service .
we approached the owner about it and he treated us like crap too .
i told him i have n't , that i know the laws .
it was not .
this was a week later and the charge went through .
they said they would have someone call me back .
so , its a really racist place that i do not recommend .
so , it 's a really racist place that i do not recommend .
unprofessional and lazy .
and i 'm calling to talk to ron or lee who own the place .
ok , a bit of explanation why i gave this place _num_ stars .
the waitress was stressed out , even though the place was n't busy .
so i think there may have been a staffing problem the day i went .
we opened the door , looked in , and walked out .
did n't think that was possible so we did n't stay .
we feel obliged to warn people about this terrible place .
without soul however , gumbo is just chicken soup .
obviously someone needs to tell him because he has n't got a clue .
he could not have handled the situation worse than he did .
her effort gave the place two stars instead of one .
what a mess !
also , crowded and dirty .
they could even raise prices .
i do n't care how cheap your product is .
not a big fan of this place !
i even tried calling the district mgr .
i am still waiting _num_ days later for a return call .
this is not a place to rent storage space from .
i 'm really getting tired of the rate hike and no notice .
this place is terrible .
terrible laundry facilities .
if you can avoid it , do n't live here .
i 'm still killing and finding roaches even after all of these treatments .
within a week all of my clothes and towels smelled musty and its terrible .
if you get within _num_ feet of it , it absolutely reeks .
this immediately stopped when i was given my keys .
i wish i would have listened to the other reviews .
but , it still feels hot in my apartment .
another problem i 've had is my stove almost everything is broken .
the laundry facilities are ridiculous they are always broken .
the pool is not up to code .
the pool is green and gross looking .
the only time they are ever fixed are when the rent is due .
the money goes to new equipment in the gym that no one uses .
bad , bad , bad .
bad service , bad food , bad experience .
i wanted to like jenny 's , but it just sucked .
and the food is atrocious .
